        <p><a href="text/Episode1ofDP.docx">Word document</a> version, and here is the <a href="text/Episode1ofDP.txt">plain text</a> version.</p> 
        
        <p>It is important to note that the place I got the script from did not include the character's names (their names are not included before their lines). I thought this would make a more true response from AntConc. However, reading the plain text will be difficult!</p>
        
        <p>It is from Netflix's <i>The Dragon Prince</i>, Episode 1, Echoes of Thunder.<i>The Dragon Prince</i> is an amazing show that has so much story and lore to it. I very much recommend this show!</p>
        
        <p>Here is the AntConc screenshot:</p>
