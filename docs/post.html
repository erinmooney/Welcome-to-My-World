        <h1>Should Fan Art be Considered “Real Art”?</h1>
        <section>
            <p class="para"> What separates fan art from “real art”? Undoubtedly, there is a
                hierarchy of artistic skill that allows a piece to be considered “a work of art.”
                Should fan art be considered real art? </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Define Art</h2>
            <p class="para">Art, as defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary, can be a “skill
                acquired by experience, study, or observation,” “an occupation requiring knowledge
                or skill,” or “the conscious use of skill and creative imagination, especially in
                the production of aesthetic objects.”</p>

            <p class="para">The definition has also been updated to exclude the idea of ‘skill’ by
                stating art as a creation that the creator intends to share. It is generally
                accepted that art is comprised of three general concepts: representation,
                expression, and form. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>How do You Feel About…</h2>
            <p class="para">…fan art? Before I lose you, what kind of art are you thinking of? The
                kind of fan art that portrays an homage to its source, or the kind that is marked
                NSFW? </p>
            <p class="para"> In this essay, I am leaving the raunchier side of fan art out of the
                discussion…even though there are copious amounts of famous pieces that can also be
                considered NSFW. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Discussion: Is Fan Art Real Art?</h2>
            <p class="para">The most common answer is: yes in technicality, but no realistically.
                Meaning, fan art is a physically made product reflecting aspects correlated to the
                idea of “art,” but socially they are not considered actual works of art. </p>
            <p class="para">Common disputes against fan art as real art are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fan art characters are not original!</li>
                <li>Fan art is only made by teenagers.</li>
                <li>Fan art is all badly executed.</li>
                <li>Fan art is cringy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para">While these disputes may have merit in some cases, other disputes only
                focus on a certain type of fan art.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>The Characters are not Original!</h2>
            <p class="para">Many famous pieces of art have the same characters or tell similar
                stories. For instance, during the Byzantine and Renaissance era of art, many
                subjects and stories were based on figures or characters from Christian and/or Pagan
                mythologies. </p>
            <p class="para">The ancient Romans valued antiquity, and appreciated ancient Greek art.
                So most ancient Roman art pieces, both written and drawn, were imitations of Greek
                art. These imitations expressed the artists’ knowledge of historic art and culture.
                Just like Raphael and Leonardo Da Vinci had workshops full of apprentices training
                to imitate their art, today, media provides a workshop-like environment where
                apprentices train to imitate media they enjoy. </p>
            <p class="para">Does this detract or eliminate them as works of art? No! These paintings
                are in museums, protected, and acclaimed for their value, level of execution, and
                beauty. </p>
            <p class="para">The degree of originality of the content within the piece is not the
                only consideration when deeming it worthy of the term “art.” </p>
            <p class="para">Style, execution, form, color theory, flow, balance, visual hierarchy,
                and harmony are all important elements in what makes created content into “art”. </p>
            <p class="para">Another argument against fan art is how it affects the original content.
                Most people might see reimagining or recreating other people’s art as stealing or
                demeaning to the originator. It is like holding a sign that says, “The original
                sucks, so I am changing it!” </p>
            <p class="para">But for those in the fan world, making fan content can be like an
                homage, fondness, or a retelling separate from the original content. In an article
                published in 2013, Marjorie Cohee Manifold shares a conversation she had with an
                experienced fan artist and fan-fiction writer named Heather. Manifold wanted context
                on how fans regard fan content. Heather responded, “We take…characters and put them
                in our own imagined worlds. It’s the ultimate ‘what if’” (2013). The way Heather
                describes fan-made works implies that there is a disconnect between the fan-made
                creation and the original content. Meaning that the fan content is a possible
                occurrence in an alternate universe, or another trajectory the author could have
                taken. </p>
            <p class="para">Fan art can be the “ultimate ‘what if,’” but can also be the ultimate
                homage. Historically, artists liked to draw their muses or create representations of
                their sources of inspiration. Just like how artists from the past would recreate
                people or places they loved, artists today recreate or reimagine characters or
                fictional places they love. </p>

            <h2>Legality</h2>
            <p class="para">The largest hindrance against fan art is legality. In the U.S., the
                usage of fan art is limited by copyright law. I have to specify ‘in the U.S.’
                because in many other countries, there is more freedom with using ‘repeat
                characters’. </p>
            <p class="para">I <i>am</i> in favor of artistic integrity and citing sources. Fan art
                should be clearly identified. The character(s) and its original media should be
                referenced. </p>
            <p class="para">If legality is the real problem, many other pieces officially recognized
                as art should be taken down based on their legal status, and other pieces should be
                rejected as art because of their infringement on previous artist’s work. </p>

            <p class="para">There are many examples of art that is in violation of the laws we hold
                art to today. These are just two examples in order to be concise. The point is that,
                today there are a lot of restrictions on art and its qualities when it is about fan
                art, but when it is about ‘real art’ those same rules do not apply. </p>

            <h2>Fan Art is Only Made by Teenagers</h2>
            <p class="para">This argument only refers to art that children or young adults make.
                Yes, some fan art can be badly executed. However, every artist starts somewhere.
                Today, Michelangelo and Leonardo Da Vinci’s sketches and unofficial pieces are
                considered art even though not all of their sketches and practice pages are great
                works of art. The point of practice pages is to be imperfect, incomplete, and
                educational to the artist. </p>

            <p class="blockQuote">Two sketches by Leonardo Da Vinci</p>

            <p class="para">There are many popular adult artists who draw fan art. They use fan art
                to practice and to give their audience an idea of who they are as an artist and as
                individuals by showing what they like. Another aspect of art creation that fan art
                helps with is artist’s block. Artist’s block is when an artist cannot seem to make a
                piece that they think is executed well. In order to combat this mental block, they
                might draw art of an established character to get back their appreciation and
                confidence. </p>

            <p class="blockQuote">“Doing new stuff is hard. And sometimes it gets you…in your own
                head and then it’s like a downward spiral of like feeling bad and not wanting to do
                art.” – Julia Lepetit, Drawfee: Professional Artists Draw Fan Art of Their Favorite
                Media (2021) </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Fan Art is All Badly Executed</h2>
            <p class="para">This seems to relate to the previously mentioned objection about fan art being made by younger folk. Most young artists make fan art in order to practice drawing, so of course it will not be as well done. But we all start somewhere because not everyone was born with the inherent ability to draw. There is as much bad fan art as there is bad ‘real’ art.
            </p>
            <p class="para">Artistic ability is like a muscle, it needs to be exercised. Practice is very important in order to excel. It is also easier to practice form and execution when the subject matter is designed for you. Manifold (2013) supports this description by stating:
            </p>
            <p class="blockQuote">“Critiques of these works would attend to skillful and appropriate uses of elements and principles of design within scenic frames and as appropriate to generic conventions… This should not be seen as diluting the focus of art education from visual to literary products, but should be recognized as an enrichment of art education by allowing a flow of influences across disciplinary boundaries of sensual experiences.”</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Fan Art is Cringy</h2>
            <p class="para">This is another fair objection. In an artistic setting, most artists do not want their art to cause their audience to cringe from second-hand embarrassment. But remember, even good art can be cringy and even original art can be cringy. I have made art that looks good and is well executed, but causes me to cringe because I can see my inexperience. Many great artists from multiple types of media will publish or make something they deem as cringy. 
            </p>
            <p class="para">There is also recent trend, as of 2019, of artists remaking famous art pieces but with influences from modern media. These pieces are well-crafted and well-executed and these pieces draw structure and inspiration from acclaimed works of art.</p>
            <p class="para">Do these works of fan art cause you to cringe?

            <h2>Modern Application</h2>
            <p class="para">There are many popular and prominent artists that also make fan art. For example, Julia Lepetit and Karina Farek are two prominent artists known for their illustrations. Jacob Andrews and Nathan Yaffe are well known for their cartoony illustrations and character designs.</p>
            <p class="para">Though they all do independent work, together these four artists have a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Drawfee">Drawfee</a>. In this channel, they broadcast both their own unique characters as well as draw fan art, which has allowed them to build a strong community and establish a secure revenue source.  In one of Drawfee’s episodes, artist Jacob Andrews talks about how drawing fan art for a show he loves, <i>Over the Garden Wall</i>, enabled him to feel less distressed and gave him a feeling of contentment: 
            </p>
            <p class="blockQuote">“I think what I like about this piece is …I ended up defaulting to what I do best. I was like, ‘I’m not going to try anything new this time. I’m just going to do what I know I can do … draw a bunch of fun characters in fun poses looking emotive.”
