        <h1>5/21/21</h1> 
        
        <p class="para">This week I played three video games and recorded the gameplay. Each day, I chopped up the footage to make either a gif or a screenshot for us to use as a marketing tweet. I also researched how other Community Managers managed their Twitter profiles so that I better understand how companies represent themselves in their tweets. </p>
        
        <p class="para"> I was also introduced to a platform called <a href="https://trello.com/?&aceid=&adposition=&adgroup=105703214328&campaign=9843285532&creative=520758394990&device=c&keyword=trello&matchtype=e&network=g&placement=&ds_kids=p53016490704&ds_e=GOOGLE&ds_eid=700000001557344&ds_e1=GOOGLE&gclid=CjwKCAjwqcKFBhAhEiwAfEr7zTsrsgg4eBtEirVthXXBUD3Jqwe_YYQPCb5x1bqUXYmSN7nBkuhO5BoCqlMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Trello</a>. It is really conducive to a collaborative work environment. I added the gifs and screenshots that I made to a thread that was specially made for Twitter and Instagram post ideas. </p>
        
        
        <h1>5/28/21</h1>
        
        <p class="para">At the beginning of the week, I played six games for content to tweet about. One game I did Q/A for, which is where you try to break a game in various ways so that it is unlikely any customer can break the game. I prepared several multi-platform capable materials so that we always have content on hand to use. I also began to study more about TikTok and Instagram so that I can participate in making content for those platforms too.  </p>
        
        <p class="para">On Thursday, I prepared ads showcasing the Steam Open World opening with two of our participating games! I had fun making an ad with the materials in the press tool kit from both Steam and Whitethorn Digital. </p>
        
        <h1>6/04/21</h1>
        
        <p class="para">This week I prepped Tiktoks, tweets, and Instagram posts. With that, I studied the business side of Tiktok and Instagram so that I understood what content would be best and how to present it. I also focused on making content for games that have not been advertised as much as others have. Since different platforms have different image requirements (like tweets work well with gifs while Instagram doesn’t) I edited and altered some of the content that I had so that it could be used on multiple platforms. With some of the work I did in Instagram, I was posting and answering questions, and it was actually really nice! I got to direct people to where they should go for troubleshooting, new releases, and console questions. </p>
        
        <p class="para">Since some game development events will be going on starting this weekend and going on for a while, I will also be participating in that collective also! </p>
        
        <h1>6/11/21</h1>
      
        <p class="para">At the start of the week, I requested early access to two of our in-progress games so that I could make good advertising material from the gameplay. On Wednesday, I got access to the games and played them for content. I also prepared Instagram posts and Tweets for the week. </p>
        
        <p class="para">Thursday was interesting because the Community Management group watched the Summer Game Fest stream! Over the weekend we will also watch more streams of game trailers and premieres. During the streams, we talk through Discord and discuss ideas on how to present our games. We talk about different ways other companies present their games and whether we like how they present the games or not. </p>
        
        
        <h1>6/18/21</h1>
        
        <p class="para">This week there were still some interesting showcases, directs, and showcases available to watch for upcoming games. As mentioned in the previous week, we still commented on how the games were presented and what kind of audiences would appreciate the game and presentation. </p>
        
        <p class="para">Most of my work was done on Instagram. I make videos and images to advertise our games and even game sales. I also interact with our community by responding to them or liking their comments. When there is a question posted in the chat, I check my facts and then respond. These questions are mostly about a game’s availability on a variety of consoles, but I have had a few people who needed help troubleshooting. </p>
        
        
        <p class="para">6/25/21</p>
        
        <p class="para">This week was pretty general with the Instagram posts. I was primarily focused on posting content from games that have not been posted about for a while. However, I also posted for one of our newest games to keep it fresh in our audience’s mind! </p>
        
        <p class="para">Friday, my supervisor and I worked on a video and text for a sale that started on the 24th. The content was prepared and used on both Twitter and Instagram. </p>
        
        <p class="para">7/02/21</p>
        
        <p class="para">The start of this week was pretty typical. I planned and made Instagram post, until Wednesday when I more specifically planned for the rest of the week. On Thursday, we reached out on Twitter, Instagram, and Discord with a job opening in the company. </p>
        
        <p class="para">Friday was a bit more interesting. The other interns, employees, and I helped move the office furniture and supplies out of storage and assembled the items as necessary. At the end of the day, I made a post about another console one of our games is now available on!</p>
        
        <p class="para">7/09/21</p>
        
        <p class="para">This week I posted about games that have not bee posted about in quite a while. More importantly, I constructed posts for a Game Sale ending and another one of our games coming out on Xbox.</p>
        
        <p class="para"> For the Game Sale, I made the post using Photoshop. With the Xbox post, I edited a video in Premier so that there was an added level of intrigue. I then added the game logo over the video and matching text that says the game is now on Xbox!</p>
        
        <p class="para">7/16/21</p>
        
        <p class="para">Throughout the week, I did my normal posts along with a Twitter post. However, I also offered to help come up with questions for an online, game-like panel! The companies have little set-ups for their business along with an NPC (Non-Player Character) with predetermined questions and programed responses. It is set up just like a -con (like Comic-con or Mega-con) with links to company merchandise as well as contact information.</p>
        
        <p class="para">This week was also a great posting week. One of my posts is almost at 1,000 likes and another gathered quite a bit of community involvement! For the post that gathered some of the community, I did some question and answer, as well as fact-checking my responses. It was really nice communicating with our players and giving them a good representation of the company!</p>
        
        <p class="para">7/23/21</p>
        
        <p class="para">For this week, I, again, posted about games that have not had as much attention as other games. Fun fact: one of my posts has over 1,000 views now! </p>
        
        <p class="para">One day that stood out was one where we choose to not post anything because of a few scandals and events that happened in the game industry. We felt that with all the disheartening news, people probably would not want to hear from a game company that day.</p>
        
        <p class="para">The other big thing that happened was prepping and posting about the aforementioned game-con. </p>
