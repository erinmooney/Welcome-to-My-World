        <p class="para">This week I played three video games and recorded the gameplay. Each day, I chopped up the footage to make either a gif or a screenshot for us to use as a marketing tweet. I also researched how other Community Managers managed their Twitter profiles so that I better understand how companies represent themselves in their tweets. </p>
        
        <p class="para"> I was also introduced to a platform called <a href="https://trello.com/?&aceid=&adposition=&adgroup=105703214328&campaign=9843285532&creative=520758394990&device=c&keyword=trello&matchtype=e&network=g&placement=&ds_kids=p53016490704&ds_e=GOOGLE&ds_eid=700000001557344&ds_e1=GOOGLE&gclid=CjwKCAjwqcKFBhAhEiwAfEr7zTsrsgg4eBtEirVthXXBUD3Jqwe_YYQPCb5x1bqUXYmSN7nBkuhO5BoCqlMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Trello</a>. It is really conducive to a collaborative work environment. I added the gifs and screenshots that I made to a thread that was specially made for Twitter and Instagram post ideas. </p>
        
        
        <h1>5/28/21</h1>
        
        <p class="para">At the beginning of the week, I played six games for content to tweet about. One game I did Q/A for, which is where you try to break a game in various ways so that it is unlikely any customer can break the game. I prepared several multi-platform capable materials so that we always have content on hand to use. I also began to study more about TikTok and Instagram so that I can participate in making content for those platforms too.  </p>
        
        <p class="para">On Thursday, I prepared ads showcasing the Steam Open World opening with two of our participating games! I had fun making an ad with the materials in the press tool kit from both Steam and Whitethorn Digital. </p>
