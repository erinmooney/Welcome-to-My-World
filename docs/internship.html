        <p class="para">This week I played three video games and recorded the gameplay. Each day, I chopped up the footage to make either a gif or a screenshot for us to use as a marketing tweet. I also researched how other Community Managers managed their Twitter profiles so that I better understand how companies represent themselves in their tweets. </p>
        
        <p class="para"> I was also introduced to a platform called Trello. It is really conducive to a collaborative work environment. I added the gifs and screenshots that I made to a thread that was specially made for Twitter and Instagram post ideas. </p>
