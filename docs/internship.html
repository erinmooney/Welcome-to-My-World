        <p class="para">This week I played three video games and recorded the gameplay. Each day, I chopped up the footage to make either a gif or a screenshot for us to use as a marketing tweet. I also researched how other Community Managers managed their Twitter profiles so that I better understand how companies represent themselves in their tweets. </p>
        
        <p class="para"> I was also introduced to a platform called <a href="https://trello.com/?&aceid=&adposition=&adgroup=105703214328&campaign=9843285532&creative=520758394990&device=c&keyword=trello&matchtype=e&network=g&placement=&ds_kids=p53016490704&ds_e=GOOGLE&ds_eid=700000001557344&ds_e1=GOOGLE&gclid=CjwKCAjwqcKFBhAhEiwAfEr7zTsrsgg4eBtEirVthXXBUD3Jqwe_YYQPCb5x1bqUXYmSN7nBkuhO5BoCqlMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Trello</a>. It is really conducive to a collaborative work environment. I added the gifs and screenshots that I made to a thread that was specially made for Twitter and Instagram post ideas. </p>
        
        
        <h1>5/28/21</h1>
        
        <p class="para">At the beginning of the week, I played six games for content to tweet about. One game I did Q/A for, which is where you try to break a game in various ways so that it is unlikely any customer can break the game. I prepared several multi-platform capable materials so that we always have content on hand to use. I also began to study more about TikTok and Instagram so that I can participate in making content for those platforms too.  </p>
        
        <p class="para">On Thursday, I prepared ads showcasing the Steam Open World opening with two of our participating games! I had fun making an ad with the materials in the press tool kit from both Steam and Whitethorn Digital. </p>
        
        <h1>6/04/21</h1>
        
        <p class="para">This week I prepped Tiktoks, tweets, and Instagram posts. With that, I studied the business side of Tiktok and Instagram so that I understood what content would be best and how to present it. I also focused on making content for games that have not been advertised as much as others have. Since different platforms have different image requirements (like tweets work well with gifs while Instagram doesn’t) I edited and altered some of the content that I had so that it could be used on multiple platforms. With some of the work I did in Instagram, I was posting and answering questions, and it was actually really nice! I got to direct people to where they should go for troubleshooting, new releases, and console questions. </p>
        
        <p class="para">Since some game development events will be going on starting this weekend and going on for a while, I will also be participating in that collective also! </p>
        
        <h1>6/11/21</h1>
      
        <p class="para">At the start of the week, I requested early access to two of our in-progress games so that I could make good advertising material from the gameplay. On Wednesday, I got access to the games and played them for content. I also prepared Instagram posts and Tweets for the week. </p>
        
        <p class="para">Thursday was interesting because the Community Management group watched the Summer Game Fest stream! Over the weekend we will also watch more streams of game trailers and premieres. During the streams, we talk through Discord and discuss ideas on how to present our games. We talk about different ways other companies present their games and whether we like how they present the games or not. </p>
        
        
        <h1>6/18/21</h1>
        
        <p class="para">This week there were still some interesting showcases, directs, and showcases available to watch for upcoming games. As mentioned in the previous week, we still commented on how the games were presented and what kind of audiences would appreciate the game and presentation. </p>
        
        <p class="para">Most of my work was done on Instagram. I make videos and images to advertise our games and even game sales. I also interact with our community by responding to them or liking their comments. When there is a question posted in the chat, I check my facts and then respond. These questions are mostly about a game’s availability on a variety of consoles, but I have had a few people who needed help troubleshooting. </p>
