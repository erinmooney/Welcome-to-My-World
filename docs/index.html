     <p>Welcome to our sample website on GitHub Pages!</p>

        <p>Here is a sample link to another website outside of this site. This link holds an <dfn>absolute URL</dfn> <a href="https://behrend.psu.edu/">Penn State Erie, The Behrend College</a>.</p>
        <p>But here is a link to another page inside my website: this is a <dfn>relative URL</dfn>:  <a href="innerPage.html"/></p>
       <!--ebb: The <img> element holds information from a separate image file, stored in the images directory inside the website directory. 
       The HTML <img> element pulls that image file into the page. You can write styling code with CSS to control relatively how much space it will take up in the browser window.
       -->
        
       <h2>A <dfn>second-level</dfn> heading, introducing an <dfn>ordered list</dfn></h2>
        <!--ebb: You can write CSS code to change the way this is ordered, from numbers to letters or symbols, for example. -->
        <ol>
            <li>morning</li>
            <li>afternoon</li>
            <li>evening</li>
            <li>midnight</li>     
        </ol>
        <h3>A <strong>third-level</strong> heading just to see what that looks like</h3>
        <p>HTML code has <em>lower-level</em> headings like from h2 to h6, but use them in order as you create subsections! 
            You can control the size, position, color, font, and more of headings (and any HTML display elements) using CSS.</p>
        <p>When should I use <b>bold</b> vs. <strong>strong</strong> in HTML code? These are <dfn>inline</dfn> elements.</p>
        <p> Other HTML elements like the <dfn>p</dfn> (for paragraph) or the heading level elements, or ordered and unorderd lists, or img elements make
            blocks on the page and are known as <dfn>block</dfn> elements.
