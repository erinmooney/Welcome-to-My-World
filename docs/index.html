                <p>Welcome to My World! Here is some information about me:</p>
                    
               <p><i>"Hello! I'm Erin Mooney, and I am an artist. Specifically, a multimedia artist which is a fancy way of saying I like to do everything. My favorite things to make art of are characters and world-building."</i></p>                    
                    
               <p><i>"One of the coolest things that an artist can do is transport the viewer to a place from the artist's imagination (or whatever subject they wanted to portray)."</i></p>

            <section><h2>Hello! <dfn>I am Erin Mooney</dfn> and I...</h2>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>...am a hard-worker</li>

                <h3><strong>About my art</strong></h3>
                <p>As you can probably tell with my little mascot, Birdard (above), I love making characters and world-building. </p>
                <p>I love creating characters and worlds. I am very imaginative and I let that imagination run wild! I think that one of the most powerful attributes an artist has, is the power to make drawings come to life. Therefore, I use that power as much as I can.</p>

            <h3>List of Favored Mediums</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Traditional</li>
                <li>Digital</li>
                <li>Photography</li>
            </ul>
                
                <p>This doesn't necessarily mean I cannot use or refuse to use others. I just really enjoy using these the most! 
                I love drawing and painting traditionally, and also digitally. I have a lot of experience drawing in Photoshop, Illustrator, and ProCreate. </p>
