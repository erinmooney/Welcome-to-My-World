                <p>As you can probably tell with my little mascot, Birdard (above), I love making characters and world-building. </p>
                <p>I love creating characters and worlds. I am very imaginative and I let that imagination run wild! I think that one of the most powerful attributes an artist has, is the power to make drawings come to life. Therefore, I use that power as much as I can.</p>

                <p>This doesn't necissarily mean I cannot use or refuse to use others. I just really enjoy using these the most! 
                I love drawing and painting traditionally, and also digitally. I have experience in drawing in Photoshop and ProCreate. </p>
