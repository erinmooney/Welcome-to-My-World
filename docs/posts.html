        <h1>GitHub vs Wordpress</h1>
        
        <p>Honestly, I think that I like using GitHub more than <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/erinmooney/">WordPress</a>. WordPress may make it a little bit easier to make aesthetically pleasing compaired to GitHub, but I just find GitHub easier to work with.</p>
        
        <p>I also find GitHub easier to work with because you can just look up the code that you want to use. Also, using oXygen is very nice. It is great at sensing incorrect coding or other inconsistences. You can physically fix specific aspects by altering the code which is great for teaching those who are new at coding. This is a spot that I need to work on because sometimes I get a little caught up in my own train of thought that I will leave bits incomplete. So, the squiggly red line of warning is a great help at teaching me where my weaknesses are.</p>
        
        <p>However, I do like being able to use different templates and color schemes using WordPress. As I said before, WordPress is easier with making websites more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
        
        <p>GitHub is easier to mess up and that makes it a bit more intimidating. But I feel like WordPress has too much of a "search-and-rescue" mission. Whenever I get on WordPress, I feel like I am missing something because there is so much going on with the interface. However, it really does make the site prettier! When I was transferring information from GitHub to WordPress, it felt so much easier than putting the actual information into WordPress directly. However, I do like how the layout on WordPress looks more than how my GitHub layout is. (And WordPress points out your typos!)</p>
        
        <p>I guess all in all I like using a mix of the two. Or at least, using oXygen and then translating it into WordPress.</p>
