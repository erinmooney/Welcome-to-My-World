        <h1>GitHub vs Wordpress</h1>
        
        <p>Honestly, I think that I like using GitHub more than Wordpress. Wordpress may make it a little bit easier to make aesthetically pleasing compaired to GitHub, but I just find GitHub better to work with.</p>
        
        <p>I also find GitHub easier to work with because you can just look up the code that you want to use. Also, using oXygen is very nice. It is great at sensing incorrect coding or other inconsistences. You can physically fix specific aspects by altering the code.</p>
        
        <p>However, I do like being able to use different templates and color schemes using Wordpress. As I said before, Wordpress is easier with making websites more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
