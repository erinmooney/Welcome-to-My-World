[SQUAWK]

[APPA GROWLING]

KATARA: Those clouds
look so soft, don't they?

Like you could just jump down

and you'd land in a big, soft,
cottony heap.

Maybe you should give it a try.

You're hilarious.


 


I'll try it!

Ha ha ha!

Yeah!

Turns out, clouds are made of water.

Hey, what is that?

It's like a scar.

SOKKA: Listen.

It's so quiet.

There's no life anywhere.

Aang, are you OK?

Fire Nation!

Those evil savages make me sick.

They have no respect for...

Shh.

What, I'm not allowed to be angry?

[SIGH]

Why would anyone do this?

How could I let this happen?

Aang, you didn't let this happen.

It has nothing to do with you.

Yes, it does.

It's the avatar's job
to protect nature,

but I don't know how to do my job.

That's why we're going
to the North Pole...

To find you a teacher.

Yeah. A waterbending teacher.

But there's no one who can
teach me how to be the Avatar.

Monk Gyatso said
that Avatar Roku would help me.

The Avatar before you?

He died over a hundred years ago.

How are you supposed to talk to him?

I don't know.

[PURRING]

Uncle, it's time to leave.

Where are you? Uncle Iroh!

Over here.

Uncle?

We need to move on.

We're closing in
on the Avatar's trail,

and I don't want to lose him.

You look tired, Prince Zuko.

Why don't you join me
in these hot springs

and soak away your troubles?

My troubles cannot be soaked away.

It's time to go!

You should take your teacher's advice

and relax a little.

The temperature's just right.

I heated it myself.

Enough. We need to leave now.

Get out of the water!

Very well.

On second thought,

why don't you take
another few minutes?

But be back at the ship
in half an hour,

or I'm leaving without you.

Ahh.

KATARA: Hey, Aang.

Are you ready to be cheered up?

No.

Ow!

Hey, how is that cheering me up?

[CHUCKLING]

Cheered me up.

Ow!

Yeah, I probably deserved that.

These acorns are everywhere, Aang.

That means the forest will grow back.

Every one of these will be
a tall oak tree someday,

and all the birds and animals

that lived here will come back.

Thanks, Katara.

[GASP]

SOKKA: Hey, who are you?

When I saw the flying bison,

I thought it was impossible,

but those markings...

Are you the Avatar, child?

My village
desperately needs your help.

This young person is the Avatar.

So the rumors of your return are true.

It is the greatest honor of a lifetime

to be in your presence.

Nice to meet you, too.

So, is there something
I can help you with?

I'm not sure.

Our village is in crisis.

He's our only hope.

For the last few days at sunset,

a spirit monster comes
and attacks our village.

He is Hei Bai,

the black and white spirit.

Why is it attacking you?

We do not know.

But each of the last three nights,

he has abducted one of our own.

We are especially fearful

because the winter solstice
draws near.

What happens then?

As the solstice approaches,

the natural world and the spirit world

grow closer and closer,

until the line between them

is blurred completely.

Hei Bai is already causing
devastation and destruction.

Once the solstice is here,

there is no telling what will happen.

So what do you want me to do exactly?

Who better to resolve a crisis

between our world and the spirit world

than the Avatar himself?

You are the great bridge

between man and spirits.

Right. That's me.

Hey, great bridge guy.

Can I talk to you over here
for a second?

Aang, you seem a little
unsure about all this.

Yeah. That might be because
I don't know anything at all

about the spirit world.

It's not like there's someone
to teach me this stuff.

So, can you help these people?

I have to try, don't I?

Maybe whatever I have to do
will just...

Come to me.

[PURRING]

I think you can do it, Aang.

Yeah.

We're all gonna get eaten
by a spirit monster.

[SNORING]

[RUSTLING]

Who's there?

[SQUEAKING]

A meadow vole.

I should have known.

You startled me, little one.

[SIGH]

Seems I dozed off and missed
my nephew's deadline,

but it was a very sweet nap.

[SQUEAKING]

[RUMBLING]

Uhh!

He's a Fire Nation soldier.

He's no ordinary soldier.

This is the Fire Lord's brother.

The Dragon of the West...

The once great General Iroh.

But now, he's our prisoner.

Hello? Spirit? Can you hear me?

This is the Avatar speaking.

I'm here to try to help stuff.

This isn't right.

We can't sit here and cower while Aang

waits for some monster to show up.

If anyone can save us, he can.

He still shouldn't have to
face this alone.

The sun is set.

Where are you, Hei Bai?

Well, spirit, uh,

I hereby ask you

to please leave this village in peace.

OK. Well, I guess
that's settled, then.

[VOICES WHISPERING]

You must be the Hei Bai spirit.
My name is...

[ROARS]

My name is Aang. I'm the avatar,

and I would like to help.

Hey, wait up!

[ROARING]

Uh...

The avatar's methods are...

Unusual.

It doesn't seem too interested

in what he's saying.

Maybe we should go help him.

No. Only the Avatar
stands a chance against the Hei Bai.

Aang will figure out
the right thing to do, Sokka.

Please, would you stop
destroying things and listen?

I'm just trying to do my job
as spirit bridge.

Excuse me.

Would you please turn around?

I command you to turn around now!

Uhh!

That's it. He needs help.

Sokka! Wait!

LEADER: It's not safe.

Hei Bai. Over here!

Sokka! Go back!

We'll fight him together, Aang.

I don't want to fight him unless I...

Sokka!

Uncle.

Uncle, where are you?

Sir, maybe he thought
you left without him.

Something's not right here.

That pile of rocks.

It looks like
there's been a landslide, sir.

Land doesn't slide uphill.

Those rocks didn't move naturally.

My uncle's been captured
by earthbenders.

[GASPING]

SOKKA: Aang! Over here!

Help!

Hang on, Sokka!

[GRUNTING]

Aah!

Uhh!

Sokka!

I've failed.

Where are you taking me?

We're taking you to face justice.

Right.

But where, specifically?

A place you're quite
familiar with, actually.

You once laid siege
to it for 600 days,

but it would not yield to you.

Ah, the great city of Ba Sing Se.

It was greater than
you were, apparently.

I acknowledge my defeat at Ba Sing Se.

After 600 days away from home,

my men were tired, and I was tired.

[YAWN]

And I'm still tired.

I'm sure they'll be back.

I know.

You should get some rest.

Everything's gonna be OK.

Your brother is in good hands.

I would be shocked

if the Avatar returned without him.

Katara? Katara, I lost him.

The sun is rising.

Perhaps he will return soon.

What? No. I'm right here.

Grr!

[GRUNTING]

I'm in the spirit world.

Ugh. Yep, that's Uncle Iroh.

AANG: I'll figure this out, Katara.
I promise.

Like they said, I'm the bridge

between the worlds, right?

All I have to do
is figure out what I have to do,

but once I do that, no problem.

[GROWLING]

Appa. Hey, buddy. I'm right here.

But I guess you can't see me, either.

[DULL ROAR]

It's OK, Appa. Don't worry.

I'm sure they're on their way back.

I bet they even found you
a bunch of moon peaches,

for a treat.

What am I supposed to do?

Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you?

Sokka?

[GROWLING]

That's definitely not Sokka.

Uhh!

What?

I can't airbend in the spirit world.

[GROWLING]

[GROWLING]

You don't know where Sokka is, do you?

[WHIMPERING]

You're Avatar Roku's animal guide,

like Appa is to me.

I need to save my friend,
and I don't know how.

Is there some way for me
to talk to Roku?

I'll be back, Katara.

Take me to Roku.

[GASP]

Oh.

What's the problem?

Nothing.

Actually, there is a bit of a problem.

My old joints
are feeling sore and achy,

and these shackles are too loose.

Too loose?

That's right. The cuffs are loose,

and they jangle around
and bump my wrists.

It would help me
if you would tighten them

so they wouldn't shake around so much.

Very well.

Corporal, tighten
the prisoner's handcuffs.

Aah!

Aah!

Aah!

AANG: Hey! What are you doing?!

Aah!

I don't understand.

This is just a statue of Roku.

Is that what Roku
wants to talk to me about?

A comet?

When can I talk to him?

[GROWLING]

It's a calendar,

and the light will reach Roku
on the solstice.

So that's when I'll be able
to speak to Roku?

[GROWLING]

But I can't wait that long.

I need to save Sokka now!

Ugh! Uhh!

Hyah!

He is too dangerous, captain.

We can't just carry him
to the capital.

We have to do something now.

I agree.

He must be dealt with immediately

and severely.

Ptoh!

KATARA: It's no use, Appa.
I don't see them anywhere.

Our best hope is to go back
to the village and wait.

[APPA GROWLS]

The Avatar.

Whoa.

Aah!

You're back!

Where's Sokka?

I'm not sure.

CAPTAIN: These dangerous hands
must be crushed.

[GRUNTING]

Hyah!

Hyah!

Excellent form, Prince Zuko.

You taught me well.

CAPTAIN: Surrender yourselves.

It's five against two.

You're clearly outnumbered.

Uh, that's true,

but you are clearly outmatched.

Hy... Ah!

Yah! Yah!

Hyah! Hyah!

[GRUNTING]

Hyah!

-Uhh!
-Uhh!

Uhh!

Uhh! Uhh!

Yah!

Oh!

[SOLDIERS GROANING]

Now, would you please
put on some clothes?

[VOICES WHISPERING]

[CHIMING]

Aah!

Aang! What are you doing?!

Run!

[ROARING]

[ROARING]

You're the spirit of this forest.

Now I understand.

You're upset and angry

because your home was burned down.

When I saw the forest had burned,

I was sad and upset,

but my friend gave me hope

that the forest would grow back.

Sokka!

What happened?

You were trapped in the spirit world
for 24 hours.

How are you feeling?

Like I seriously need
to use the bathroom.

Thank you, Avatar.

If only there were a way

to repay you for what you've done.

You could give us
some supplies and some money.

-Sokka.
-What?

We need stuff.

It would be an honor
to help you prepare for your journey.

I'm so proud of you, Aang.

You figured out what to do
all on your own.

Actually, I did have a little help.

And there's something else.

What is it?

I need to talk to Roku,

and I think I found a way

to contact his spirit.

-That's great.
-Creepy, but great.

There's a temple
on a crescent-shaped island,

and if I go there on the solstice,

I'll be able to speak with him.

But the solstice is tomorrow.

Yeah, and there's one more problem.

The island is in the Fire Nation.
