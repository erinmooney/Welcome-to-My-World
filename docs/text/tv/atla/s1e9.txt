[PANTING]

SOKKA: Would you sit down?!

If we hit a bump,
you'll go flying off!

What's bugging you anyway?

It's what Avatar Roku said.

I'm supposed to master
all four elements

before that comet arrives.

Well, let's see.


 


You pretty much mastered airbending,

and that only took you 112 years.

I'm sure you can master

three more elements by next summer.

I haven't even started waterbending,

and we're still weeks away
from the North Pole.

What am I gonna do?!

Calm down.

It's gonna be OK.

If you want,

I can try and teach you

some of the stuff I know.

You'd do that?

We'll need to find

a good source of water first.

Maybe we can find a puddle
for you to splash in.

Nice puddle.

[SNORTING]

[SCREECHES]

AANG: Yeah!

Don't start without me, boy!

Remember the reason we're here.

Oh, right.

Time to practice waterbending.

Great. So, what am I supposed to do?

You could clean the gunk

out of Appa's toes.

So, while you guys
are playing in the water,

I'm supposed to be hard at work

picking mud
out of a giant bison's feet?

Mud and bugs.

OK.

[GRUNTING]

Whoa! Whoa!

Oof!

Someone's changing our course.

What's the meaning of this mutiny?

No one told you to change course.

Actually, someone did.

I assure you,

it is a matter of utmost importance,

Prince Zuko.

Is it something to do with the Avatar?

Even more urgent.

It seems I...

I've lost my lotus tile.

Lotus tile?

For my pai sho game.

Most people think the lotus tile

insignificant.

But it is essential
for the unusual strategy

that I employ.

You've changed our course
for a stupid lotus tile?

See, you, like most people,

underestimate its value.

Just give me 10 minutes
to check the merchants

at this port of call.

Hopefully, they'll have
the lotus tile in stock

and I can get on with my life.

[BREATHING DEEPLY]

I'm lucky to have such
an understanding nephew.

[SIGHS]

Yeah, don't get too happy.

You've got to do me next.

[SIGHS]

This is a pretty basic move,

but it still took me
months to perfect.

So, don't be frustrated

if you don't get it right away.

Just push and pull the water
like this.

The key is getting
the wrist movement right.

Like this?

That's almost right.

If you keep practicing,

I'm sure eventually...

Hey, I'm bending it already!

Wow! I can't believe
you got that so quickly.

It took me two months
to learn that move.

Well, you had to figure it out

all on your own.

I'm lucky enough
to have a great teacher.

Thanks.

So, what's next?

This is a more difficult move.

I call it streaming the water.

It's harder than it looks,

so don't be disappointed if...

Nice work.

Though the over-the-head
flair was unnecessary.

Sorry.

Well, don't stop now.

Keep 'em coming.

Well, I kind of know
this one other move,

But it's pretty hard.

I haven't even totally
figured it out yet.

The idea is to create
a big, powerful wave.

[GRUNTS]

So, like this?

Aang!

Looks like I got
the hang of that move.

What else you got?

That's enough practicing for today.

Yeah, I'll say!

You just practiced our supplies

Down the river.

Uh, sorry.

I'm sure we can find some way

to replace all this stuff.

My life was hard enough

when you were just an airbender.

[PEOPLE CHATTERING]

MAN: Please, put me down!

VENDOR: See the wonder in this bag!

Who's brave enough
to look into this bag?!

Wow!

We've got exactly
three copper pieces left

from the money that King Bumi gave us.

Let's spend it wisely.

Uh, make that
two copper pieces, Sokka.

I couldn't say no to this whistle.

[AIR HISSES]

It doesn't even work.

[SQUEALS]

See? Even Momo thinks
it's a piece of junk.

No offense, Aang,

but I'll hold the money from now on.

MAN: Earth Nation! Fire Nation!

Water Nation.

So long as bargains
are your inclination,

you're welcome here!

Don't be shy.

Come on by!

Oh, you there!

I can see from your clothing

that you're world traveling types.

Perhaps I can interest you

in some exotic curios?

Sure!

What are curios?

I'm not entirely sure,

But we got 'em.

[GASPS]

Huh?

MAN: I've never seen
such a fine specimen of lemur.

That beast would fetch me a hefty sum

if you'd be interested in bartering.

[SQUAWKS]

[HISSES]

Momo's not for sale.

Look at this, Aang!

It's a waterbending scroll.

Check out these crazy moves.

Where did you get
a waterbending scroll?

Let's just say I got it up north

at a most reasonable price...

Free.

Wait a minute.

Sea-loving traders

with suspiciously acquired merchandise

and pet reptile birds?

You guys are pirates!

We prefer to think of ourselves as

high-risk traders.

So, how much for the traded scroll?

I've already got a buyer...

A nobleman in the Earth Kingdom...

Unless, of course, you kids have

200 gold pieces on you right now.

I know how to deal
with these guys, Katara.

Pirates love to haggle.

Watch and learn.

What say ye to the price of...

One copper piece?

Ha ha ha ha!

The price is 200 gold pieces.

I don't haggle on items this rare.

OK, two copper pieces.

It's not as amusing
the second time, boy.

Aang, can we get out of here?

I feel like we're getting weird looks.

Aye! We be casting off now!

What was that all about, Katara?

Yeah, I was just starting
to browse through

their boomerang collection.

I'll just feel a lot better

once we get away from here.

Hey, you!

Get back here!

Well, well.

Look who's come to their senses.

Told you the haggling would pay off.

[GROWLING]

There they are!

Get 'em!

Nobody's going nowhere!

[LAUGHING]

I don't think these pirates

are here to trade with us.

Get back here!

You little...

Come on!

This way.

Let's cut 'em off!

Whoa!

Whoa!

Oof!

Oh! Oh!

Oh! Oh!

[SCREAMING]

My cabbages!

This place is worse than Omashu!

[GROANING]

Aha!

[SHUDDERS]

I hope that lemur of yours

has nine lives.

Now, who gets to taste

the steel of my blade first?

No, thanks.

Haa!

[SCREAMS]

Grab on tight!

Aang, I thought we were

running away from the pirates.

Just hang on.

BOTH: Whoa!

Ow!

Whoa!

I used to kind of look up to pirates,

but those guys are terrible.

I know.

That's why I took this.

No way!

Isn't it great?!

No wonder they were
trying to hack us up.

You stole their waterbending scroll.

I prefer to think of it as

high-risk trading.

Ha ha ha.

Good one, Katara.

Sokka, where to you think they got it?

They stole it from a waterbender.

It doesn't matter.

You put all of our lives in danger

just so you could learn

some stupid, fancy splashes.

These are real waterbending forms.

You know how crucial it is

for Aang to learn waterbending.

[SIGHS]

Whatever.

Well, what's done is done.

We have it.

We might as well learn from it.

I've checked all the shops
on this pier.

Not a lotus tile
in the entire marketplace.

It's good to know this trip

was a complete waste of time

for everyone!

Quite the contrary.

I always say
the only thing better than

finding something you are looking for

is finding something
you weren't looking for

at a great bargain.

You bought a sungi horn?

For music night on the ship.

Now, if we only had some woodwinds.

Oh, this place looks promising.

Oh, that is handsome!

Wouldn't it look
magnificent in the galley?

We lost the water tribe girl

and the little bald monk

she was traveling with.

This monk, did he have
an arrow on his head?

[IMITATES MONKEY]

I just want to try
this one move first,

and then it's all yours.

Here, hold it open for me.

The single water whip.

Looks doable.

Ow!

Ha ha ha!

What's so funny?

I'm sorry, but you deserved that.

You've been duped.

She's only interested
in teaching herself.

Aang will get his turn

once I figure out the water whip.

[SCREECHES]

Ugh! Why can't I get
this stupid move?!

You'll get it.

You've just gotta shift your weight

through the stances.

There. See?

The key to bending is...

Will you please shut your air hole!

Believe it or not,
your infinite wisdom

gets a little old sometimes!

Why don't we just
throw the scroll away

since you're so naturally gifted?!

What?!

Oh, my gosh, Aang.

I am so sorry.

I don't know what came over me.

But you know what?

It won't happen again.

Here, this is yours.

I don't want to have

anything to do with it anymore.

It's OK, Katara.

What about Momo?

He's the real victim here.

I'm sorry, Momo.

And what about me?

There was that time you...

No more apologies.

Shouldn't we stop to search the woods?

We don't need to stop.

They stole
a waterbending scroll, right?

Mm-hmm.

Then they'll be on the water.

[PURRS]

Shh.

Momo, go back to sleep.

[COOS]

Shh!

[GRUNTING]

Shoot!

Come on, water! Work with me here!

OK, what if I... Ow!

[DISTANT YELLING]

OK, Katara,

shift your weight through the stances.

Ugh!

[SCRAPING]

[GASPS]

Ah! No!

Let go of me!

[GRUNTS]

I'll save you from the pirates.

Tell me where he is,

and I won't hurt you or your brother.

Go jump in the river!

Try to understand,

I need to capture him

to restore something I've lost...

My honor.

Perhaps in exchange,

I can restore something you've lost.

My mother's necklace.

How did you get that?!

I didn't steal it

if that's what you're wondering.

Tell me where he is.

No!

Enough of this necklace garbage.

You promised the scroll.

I wonder how much money this is worth.

[GASPS] No!

A lot, apparently.

Now, you help me find what I want,

you'll get this back,

and everyone goes home happy.

Search the woods for the boy
and meet back here.

Fine.

[GROANING]

Huh?

Where did she go?

I don't believe it.

[YAWNS]

What's wrong?

She took the scroll.

She's obsessed with that thing.

It's just a matter of time

before she gets us all in deep...

Whoa!

[SCREAMS]

[YELLS]

[GRUNTS]

I've got him. Come on!

Oh, what?
I'm not good enough to kidnap?

Aagh!

Nice work.

[STRAINING]

Aang, this is all my fault.

No, Katara, it isn't.

Yeah, it kind of is.

Give me the boy.

You give us the scroll.

You're really gonna
hand over the Avatar

for a stupid piece of parchment?

Don't listen to him.

He's trying to turn
us against each other.

Your friend is the Avatar?

Sure is.

And I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more

on the black market
than that fancy scroll.

Shut your mouth,

you water tribe peasant!

Yeah, Sokka,
you really should shut your mouth.

I'm just saying,

it's bad business sense.

Just imagine how much the Fire Lord

would pay for the Avatar.

You guys would be set for life.

Keep the scroll.

We can buy 100 with the reward

we'll get for the kid.

You'll regret breaking a deal with me.

[GROWLS]

[SCREAMING]

[YELLING]

Thanks, Momo.

I owe you a bushel of apples.

[COUGHING]

[GRUNTS]

Hey!

[SQUAWKS]

[SQUAWK]

[SWORDS CLANGING]

Aah!

Aang, are you there?

I'm over here! Follow my voice.

Where? I can't find you!

I'm right here!

Uh, never mind.

I'll find you!

Run!

Katara, you're OK.

Help me get this boat
back in the water

so we can get out of here.

[ALL STRAINING]

We need a team of rhinos

to budge this ship.

A team of rhinos...

Or two waterbenders.

KATARA: Everybody in!

Are you so busy fighting

you cannot see your own ship

has set sail?

We have no time
for your proverbs, uncle.

It's no proverb.

Bleeding hog monkeys!

Ha ha ha ha!

[LAUGHING]

Hey, that's my boat!

Maybe it should be a proverb.

Come on, uncle.

Sokka, can't you make it
go any faster?

I don't know how.

This thing wasn't made
by the water tribe.

[GRUNTING]

Whoa!

Whoa!

Oof!

Hey! You did the water whip.

I couldn't have done it
without your help.

Will you two quit
congratulating each other

and help me out?

[SQUEAKING]

[SCREAMING]

That's good.

Wah!

Hah!

[SCREAMING]

Aang, look!

Oh, no!

[AIR HISSING]

Aah! Oh!

Have you lost your mind?

This is no time for flute practice!

We can stop the boat.

Aang, together,

push and pull the water.

It's working.

It's slowing down.

We're doing it!

But we have another problem.

Whoa! Whoa!

Jump!

[SCREAMING]

AANG: I knew a bison whistle
would come in handy.

Thanks, Appa.

SOKKA: Yeah, we owe you one.

[GRUNTS]

My boat!

[PANTING]

[CHUCKLES]

Prince Zuko,

you're really going to
get a kick out of this.

That lotus tile
was in my sleeve the whole time!

[GROWLING]

[GRUNTS]

KATARA: Aang,

I still owe you an apology.

You were just so good at waterbending

without really trying.

I got so competitive

that I put us all in danger.

I'm sorry.

That's OK, Katara.

Besides, who needs
that stupid scroll anyway?

Is that really how you feel?

The scroll!

First, what did you learn?

Stealing is wrong.

Unless it's from pirates.

AANG: Ha ha ha!

Good one, Katara.
