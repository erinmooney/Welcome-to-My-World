KATARA: We need you, Aang.

I need you, too.

[THUNDER RUMBLING]

Be careful, guys!

Guys?

Gyatso?

GYATSO: Why did you disappear?

I didn't mean to.

We need you, Aang.

AANG: [SCREAMS]


 


VOICES: We need you, Aang.
We need you.

We need you, Aang. We need you.

-[GASPS]
-MOMO: [CHATTERING]

Huh! What's going on?

Did we get captured again?

It's nothing. I just had a bad dream.

Go back to sleep.

You don't have to tell me twice.

Are you all right, Aang?

I'm okay.

You seem to be having
a lot of nightmares lately.

You want to tell me about it?

I think I just need some rest.

You guys want to hear about my dream?

That's okay. I didn't want
to talk about it anyway.

[GRUMBLING]

Look at those clear skies, buddy.

Should be some smooth flying.

Well, we'd better
smoothly fly ourselves to a market,

because we're out of food.

Guys, wait. This was in my dream.

We shouldn't go to the market.

What happened in your dream?

Food eats people!

Also, Momo could talk.

You said some very unkind things.

[CHATTERS]

[SNIFFS]

There is a storm coming.

A big one.

You're out of your mind, uncle.

The weather is perfect.
There's not a cloud in sight.

A storm is approaching from the north.

I suggest we alter our course
and head southwest.

We know the Avatar
is traveling northward,

so we will do the same.

Prince Zuko,
consider the safety of the crew.

The safety of the crew doesn't matter.

Finding the Avatar
is far more important

than any individual's safety.

He doesn't mean that.
He's just all worked up.

It's good.
It's perfect, I'm telling you.

[SWISHING]

I don't know if I like
the sound of that swishing.

Swishing means it's ripe.

It's the ripe juices
swishing around, huh?

I think it's true, Katara.

Swishing means it's ripe.

I just realized
we're out of money anyway.

Aww...

Out of food and out of money.

Now what are we supposed to do?

You could get a job, smart guy.

WOMAN: We shouldn't go out there.

Please! The fish can wait.

There's going to be a terrible storm.

Aw, you're crazy. It's a nice day.

No clouds, no wind, no nothing,

so quit your nagging, woman.

Maybe we should find some shelter.

Are you kidding? Shelter from what?

WOMAN: My joints say
there's going to be a storm,

a bad one.

Well, it's your joints
against my brain.

Then I hope your brain can find
someone else to haul that fish,

'cause I ain't coming!

Then I'll find a new fish hauler,

and pay him double what you get.

How do you like that?

I'll go.

You're hired.

What? You said get a job.

And he's paying double.

Double? Who told you that nonsense?

Oh. Looks like your uncle was right
about the storm after all.

Lucky guess.

Lieutenant,
you'd better learn some respect,

or I will teach it to you.

What do you know about respect?

The way you talk
to everyone around here,

from your hard-working crew
to your esteemed uncle,

shows you know nothing about respect.

You don't care about
anyone but yourself.

Then again, what should I expect
from a spoiled prince?

Easy now.

Enough!

We're all a bit tired
from being at sea so long.

I'm sure after a bowl of noodles,

everyone will feel much better.

I don't need your help
keeping order on my ship.

Sokka, maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

Look at the sky.

I said I was gonna do this job.

I can't back out just because
of some bad weather.

WOMAN: The boy with the tattoos
has some sense.

You should listen to him.

Boy with tattoos?

Airbender tattoos.

Well, I'll be a hog monkey's uncle.

You're the Avatar, ain't you?

That's right.

Well, don't be so smiley about it.

The Avatar disappeared
for a hundred years!

You turned your back on the world.

Don't yell at him!

Aang would never
turn his back on anyone.

Oh, he wouldn't, huh?

Then I guess I must have imagined

the last hundred years
of war and suffering.

Aang is the bravest person I know.

He has done nothing but help people,

and save lives since I met him.

It's not his fault he disappeared,
right, Aang?

Aang, what's wrong?

That's right! Keep flying!

You're a horrible old man!

Ehh!

Appa, yip yip!

Uhh!

Hey! They left
without saying good-bye.

Your friends ain't too polite,
are they?

I know. This one time, I was...

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get below deck.

I'm sorry for running away.

It's okay. That fisherman
was way out of line.

Actually, he wasn't.

What do you mean?

I don't want to talk about it.

It has to do with your dream,
doesn't it?

Talk to me.

Well, it's kind of a long story.

APPA: [GRUMBLING]

I'm gonna try to get
a little fire going.

I'll never forget the day
the monks told me I was the Avatar.

I was playing with some other kids
just outside the south wall.

I was trying to teach them
how to do the air scooter.

First you form a ball.
Then you've got to get on quick.

Ha ha ha!

Yeah! Ha ha ha!

Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

Okay, here goes.

Quick. Get on.

Whoa. Whoa...

Uhh!

You kind of have to balance on it
like it's a top.

Man, that's hard.

Where did you learn that trick, Aang?

I made it up.

Wow!

GYATSO: Aang, come with us.

We need to speak with you.

AANG: How do you know it's me?

We have known you were
the Avatar for some time.

Do you remember these?

Those were some of my favorite toys
when I was little.

You chose them
from among thousands of toys, Aang.

The toys you picked
were the four Avatar relics.

These items belonged to Avatars past.

Your own past lives.

I just chose them
because they seemed fun.

You chose them
because they were familiar.

Normally, we would have told you
of your identity when you turned 16.

But there are troubling signs.

Storm clouds are gathering.

I fear that war may be upon us,
young Avatar.

We need you, Aang.

I'm sick of taking his orders,

and I'm tired of chasing his Avatar.

I mean, who does Zuko think he is?

Do you really want to know?

General Iroh, we were just...

It's okay.

May I join you?

Of course, sir.

Try to understand,

my nephew is a complicated young man.

He has been through much.

Let me in!

Prince Zuko, what's wrong?

I want to go into the war chamber,

but the guard won't let me pass.

You're not missing anything. Trust me.

These meetings are dreadfully boring.

If I'm going to rule
this nation one day,

don't you think I need
to start learning as much as I can?

Very well,
but you must promise not to speak.

These old folks are a bit sensitive,
you know?

Thank you, uncle.

The Earth Kingdom defenses
are concentrated here,

a dangerous battalion
of their strongest earthbenders,

and fiercest warriors.

So, I am recommending
the 41st division.

But the 41st is entirely new recruits.

How do you expect them to defeat
a powerful Earth Kingdom battalion?

I don't.

They'll be used as a distraction

while we mount an attack
from the rear.

What better to use as bait
than fresh meat?

You can't sacrifice
an entire division like that!

Those soldiers love
and defend our nation.

How can you betray them?

Zuko was right, you see?

But it was not his place to speak out.

And there were dire consequences.

So you were upset
that you were the Avatar?

Why wouldn't you be excited about it?

Well, I didn't know
how to feel about it.

All I knew was that after I found out,

everything began changing.

AANG: Hey, not bad.

You guys have been practicing.

Not only that,

we made up a game you can play
with the air scooters.

Great!

What's going on?

Now that you're the Avatar,

it's kind of an unfair advantage

for whichever team you're on.

But I'm still the same.

Nothing has changed.

So, what? I can't play?

That's the only fair way.

Oh, okay...

Sorry, Aang.

Okay, now, who wants
to have Jinju on their team?

[LAUGHS]

Very interesting move, young one.

What do you mean?

Hey! Ha ha ha!

Ha ha ha!

You're playing games with him?

The Avatar should be training.

Aang has already
trained enough for today.

Time is short. Come with me.

I must test you
on some high-level techniques.

No. As long as I am his guardian,

I will decide when he trains

And when he gets his butt kicked
at Pai Sho.

Hmmph!

After Zuko's outburst in the meeting,

the Fire Lord became
very angry with him.

He said that Prince Zuko's
challenge of the general

was an act of complete disrespect.

And there was only one way
to resolve this.

Agni Kai. A fire duel.

That's right.

Zuko looked upon
the old general he had insulted,

and declared that he was not afraid.

But Zuko misunderstood.

When he turned to face his opponent,

he was surprised to see
it was not the general.

Zuko had spoken out
against the general's plan,

but by doing so
in the Fire Lord's war room,

it was the Fire Lord
whom he had disrespected.

Zuko would have to duel
his own father.

Then, just when
I was starting to feel better,

something worse happened.

Aang needs to have freedom and fun.

He needs to grow up as a normal boy.

Hmm. You cannot keep protecting him
from his destiny.

Gyatso, I know you mean well,

but you are letting your affection
for the boy cloud your judgment.

All I want is what is best for him.

But what we need
is what's best for the world.

You and Aang must be separated.

The Avatar will be sent away
to the Eastern Air Temple

to complete his training.

That's awful, Aang.

I don't know what to say.

How could they do that to me?

They wanted to take away
everything I knew,

and everyone I loved!

Whoa! Hot cinders.

I'm sorry I got so mad.

You have a right to be angry

after the monks
sent you away like that.

Well, that's not exactly
what happened.

[LAUGHING]

I was afraid and confused.

I didn't know what to do.

Aang?

I'm not going to let them
take you away from me.

Aang?

[GASPS]

I never saw Gyatso again.

[SCREAMING]

[ROARING]

Next thing I knew,
I was waking up in your arms

after you found me in the iceberg.

You ran away.

And then the Fire Nation
attacked our temple.

My people needed me,
and I wasn't there to help.

You don't know what would have...

The world needed me,
and I wasn't there to help.

-Aang...
-The fisherman was right.

I did turn my back on the world.

You're being too hard on yourself.

Even if you did run away,

I think it was meant to be.

If you had stayed,
you would have been killed

along with all the other airbenders.

You don't know that.

I know it's meant to be this way.

The world needs you now.

You give people hope.

[CHATTERS]

IROH: When Prince Zuko saw
that it was his father

who had come to duel him,

he begged for mercy.

Please, father,

I only had the Fire Nation's
best interests at heart.

I'm sorry I spoke out of turn.

You will fight for your honor.

I meant you no disrespect.

I am your loyal son.

Rise and fight, Prince Zuko.

I won't fight you.

You will learn respect,

and suffering will be your teacher.

IROH: I looked away.

ZUKO: [SCREAMING]

I always thought that Prince Zuko
was in a training accident.

It was no accident.

After the duel,

the Fire Lord said
that by refusing to fight,

Zuko had shown shameful weakness.

As punishment, he was banished,

and sent to capture the Avatar.

Only then could he return
with his honor.

So that's why he's so obsessed.

Capturing the Avatar
is the only chance he has

of things returning to normal.

Things will never return to normal,

but the important thing is,

the Avatar gives Zuko hope.

Help! Oh, please, help!

It's okay. You're safe.

But my husband isn't.

What do you mean? Where's Sokka?

They haven't returned.

They should have been back by now.

And this storm is becoming a typhoon.

They're caught out at sea!

I'm going to find them.

I'm going with you.

I'm staying here.

We'll be back soon. I promise.

[GRUMBLING]

Where were we hit?

I don't know.

Look!

ZUKO: The helmsman!

Aah!

Where are they?

Come on, Appa!

The boat! There!

The Avatar!

What do you want to do, sir?

Let him go.

We need to get this ship to safety.

Then we must head directly
into the eye of the storm.

I'm too young to die!

I'm not, but I still don't want to!

[GASPS]

Hang on to the rope!

Whoa! Whoa!

[BOTH GASPING]

Uncle, I am sorry.

Your apology is accepted.

Oh! You're alive!

You owe this boy an apology.

He doesn't have to apologize.

What if, instead of an apology,

I give him a free fish,
and we call it even?

Actually, I don't eat meat.

Fish ain't meat.

Seriously, you're still gonna pay me,
right?

Aah!

Katara, I think you were right before.

I'm done dwelling on the past.

Really?

I can't make guesses about
how things would have turned out

If I hadn't run away.

I'm here now, and I'm going
to make the most of it.

I don't think you're gonna have
those nightmares anymore.

If you weren't here now...

Well, I guess, I wouldn't be either.

Thank you for saving my life, Avatar.

Do you hear that?

It stopped raining.

[GRUMBLING]

AANG: Uh! Appa!

[CLOSING THEME PLAYING]
