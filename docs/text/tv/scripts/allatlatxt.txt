-Yay! Yay!
-Aang's back!

[CHILDREN LAUGHING]

I knew it.

You signaled the Fire Navy
with that flare.

You're leading them
straight to us, aren't you?

Aang didn't do anything.

It was an accident.

Yeah, we were on the ship

and there was this booby trap,

and, well, we...

We boobied right into it.


 


Katara, you shouldn't have
gone on that ship.

Now we could all be in danger.

Don't blame Katara.

I brought her there.

It's my fault.

A-ha!

The traitor confesses!

Warriors, away from the enemy!

The foreigner is banished
from our village.

Sokka, you're making a mistake.

No, I'm keeping my promise to dad.

I'm protecting you
from threats like him.

Aang is not our enemy.

Don't you see?

Aang's brought us something

we haven't had in a long time... Fun.

Fun? We can't fight firebenders
with fun!

You should try it sometime.

Get out of our village, now!

Grandmother, please,
don't let Sokka do this.

Katara, you knew going on
that ship was forbidden.

Sokka is right.

I think it best
if the airbender leaves.

Fine, then I'm banished, too.

Come on, Aang, let's go.

Where do you think you're going?

To find a waterbender.

Aang is taking me to the North Pole.

I am?

-Great!
-SOKKA: Katara!

Would you really choose him
over your tribe,

your own family?

Katara, I don't want to come between
you and your family.

So you're leaving the South Pole?

This is goodbye?

Thanks for penguin sledding with me.

Where will you go?

Guess I'll go back home
and look for the airbenders.

Wow.

I haven't cleaned my room
in 100 years.

Not looking forward to that.

It was nice meeting everyone.

Let's see your bison fly now, Airboy.

Come on, Appa, you can do it.

Yip yip!

[APPA GROANS]

Yeah, I thought so!

[CRYING]

Aang, don't go.

I'll miss you.

I'll miss you, too.

Come on, boy.

[WHIMPERS]

Katara, you'll feel better after you...

You happy now?

There goes my one chance
of becoming a waterbender!

All right, ready our defenses!

The Fire Nation could be
on our shores any moment now!

But I got to...

And no potty breaks!

[YAWNS]

Yeah, I liked her, too.

[GASPS]

The village!

Appa, wait here!

[EXPLOSION]

[GASPING]

[RUMBLING]

Oh, man!

[WHIMPERING]

Oh, man.

[VILLAGERS SCREAMING]

Sokka! Get out of the way!

[SHOUTING]

Where are you hiding him?

He'd be about this age,

master of all elements.

I know you're hiding him.

[SHOUTING]

Show no fear!

[CHEERING]

[CHEERING]

Hey, Katara. Hey, Sokka.

Hi, Aang.

Thanks for coming.

Looking for me?

You're the airbender?

You're the Avatar?

Aang?

No way.

I've spent years preparing
for this encounter,

training, meditating.

You're just a child.

Well, you're just a teenager.

If I go with you,

will you promise
to leave everyone alone?

No, Aang, don't do this.

Don't worry, Katara.

It'll be OK.

Unh!

Take care of Appa for me
until I get back.

Head a course to the Fire Nation.

I'm going home.

We have to go after that ship, Sokka.

Aang saved our tribe.

Now we have to save him.

Katara, I...

Why can't you realize
that he's on our side?

If we don't help him, no one will.

I know you don't like Aang,
but we owe him and...

Katara, are you going to talk all day

or are you coming with me?

Sokka!

Get in.

We're going to save your boyfriend.

-He's not my...
-Whatever.

What do you two think you're doing?

You'll need these.

You have a long journey ahead of you.

It's been so long since I've had hope,

but you brought it back to life,

my little waterbender.

And you, my brave warrior,

be nice to your sister.

Yeah, OK, Gran.

Aang is the Avatar.

He's the world's only chance.

You both found him for a reason.

Now your destinies
are intertwined with his.

There's no way we're going to catch

a warship with a canoe.

[GRUMBLING]

Appa!

You just love taking me
out of my comfort zone,

don't you?

This staff will make
an excellent gift for my father.

I suppose you wouldn't
know of fathers,

being raised by monks.

Take the Avatar to the prison hold

and take this to my quarters.

Hey, you mind taking this
to his quarters for me?

Ugh!

So, I guess you've never fought
an airbender before.

I bet I can take you both

with my hands tied behind my back.

MAN: Silence.

MAN: The Avatar has escaped!

SOKKA: Go.

Fly.

Soar.

Please, Appa, we need your help.

Aang needs your help.

Up.

Ascend.

Elevate.

Sokka doesn't believe you can fly,

But I do, Appa.

Come on, don't you want to save Aang?

What was it that kid said?

Yee-ha?

Hup-hup?

Wa-hoo?

Uh, yip yip?

[APPA GROWLS]

KATARA: You did it, Sokka!

He's flying!

He's flying!

Katara, he's...

I mean, big deal.

He's flying.

Aah!

You haven't seen
my staff around, have you?

Thanks, anyway.

[MAN SNORING]

Sorry.

My staff!

Looks like I underestimated you.

[APPA GROWLING]

What is that?

Appa!

Aang, no!

Aang! Aang!

Aang!

Did you see what he just did?

Now that was some waterbending.

KATARA: Aang, are you OK?

Hey, Katara.

Hey, Sokka.

Thanks for coming.

Well, I couldn't let you
have all the glory.

I dropped my staff.

Got it.

Ha!

That's from the water tribe!

Katara!

[GRUNTING]

Hurry up, Sokka!

I'm just a guy with a boomerang.

I didn't ask for all this
flying and magic.

Yip yip! Yip yip!

Huh?

Huh?

Shoot them down!

[LAUGHING]

Good news for the Fire Lord.

The Fire Nation's greatest threat

is just a little kid.

That kid, uncle, just did this.

I won't underestimate him again.

Dig this ship out and follow them.

As soon as you're done with that.

KATARA: How did you
do that with the water?

It was the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

I don't know.

I just sort of did it.

Why didn't you tell us
you were the Avatar?

Because I never wanted to be.

But, Aang, the world's been waiting
for the Avatar to return

and finally put an end to this war.

And how am I going to do that?

According to legend,

You need to first master water,

then earth, then fire, right?

That's what the monks told me.

Well, if we go to the north pole,

you can master waterbending.

We could learn it together!

And, Sokka,
I'm sure you'll get to knock

some firebender heads on the way.

I'd like that.

I'd really like that.

Then we're in this together.

All right,
but before I learn waterbending,

we have some
serious business to attend to

here, here, and here.

What's there?

Here we'll ride the hopping llamas.

Then way over here we'll surf
on the backs of giant koi fish.

Then back over here
we'll ride the hog monkeys.

They don't like people riding them,

but that's what makes it fun!

Wait till you see it, Katara.

The air temple
is one of the most beautiful places

in the world.

Aang, I know you're excited,

but it's been a hundred years

since you've been home.

That's why I'm so excited!

It's just that a lot can change
in all that time.

I know,

but I need to see it for myself.

[SNORING]

Wake up, Sokka.

Air temple, here we come!

[GROAN]

Sleep now. Temple later.

[SNORING]

Sokka, wake up!

There's a prickle snake
in your sleeping bag!

Aah!

Get it off! Get it off!

Aah!

Heh heh heh!

Great. You're awake.

Let's go.

Uncle, I want the repairs made

as quickly as possible.

I don't want to stay too long

and risk losing his trail.

You mean the Avatar?

Don't mention his name on these docks.

Once word gets out that he's alive,

every firebender
will be out looking for him,

and I don't want anyone
getting in the way.

Getting in the way of what,

Prince Zuko.

Captain Zhao.

It's commander now.

And General Iroh,

great hero of our nation.

Retired general.

The Fire Lord's brother and son

are welcome guests anytime.

What brings you to my harbor?

Our ship is being repaired.

That's quite a bit of damage.

Yes. You wouldn't believe
what happened.

Uncle, tell Commander Zhao
what happened.

Yes, I will do that.

It was incredible.

What, did we crash or something?

Yes! Right into an Earth Kingdom ship.

Really?

You must regale me
with all the thrilling details.

Join me for a drink?

Sorry, but we have to go.

Prince Zuko,

show Commander Zhao your respect.

We would be honored to join you.

Do you have any ginseng tea?
It's my favorite.

[GRUNT]

[RUMBLES]

Hey, stomach, be quiet, all right?

I'm trying to find us some food.

Hey! Who ate all
my blubbered seal jerky?

Oh. That was food?

I used it to start
the campfire last night.

Sorry.

You what?

Aww.

No wonder the flames smelled so good.

AANG: The Potola mountain range!

We're almost there!

Aang, before we get to the temple,

I want to talk to you
about the airbenders.

What about them?

Well...

I just want you to be prepared

for what you might see.

The Fire Nation is ruthless.

They killed my mother,

and they could have done the same

to your people.

Just because no one
has seen an airbender

doesn't mean the Fire Nation
killed them all.

They probably escaped.

I know it's hard to accept.

You don't understand, Katara.

The only way to get to
an airbender temple

is on a flying bison,

and I doubt the Fire Nation
has any flying bison.

Right, Appa?

[APPA GROWLS]

Yip yip!

AANG: There it is,
the Southern Air Temple.

Aang, it's amazing!

We're home, buddy. We're home.

And by year's end,

the Earth Kingdom capital
will be under our rule.

The Fire Lord will finally claim

victory in this war.

If my father thinks
the rest of the world

will follow him willingly,

then he is a fool.

Two years at sea

have done little
to temper your tongue.

So, how's your search
for the Avatar going?

[CRASH]

Uh... My fault entirely.

We haven't found him yet.

Did you really expect to?

The Avatar died a hundred years ago

along with the rest of the airbenders.

Unless you found some evidence

that the Avatar is alive.

No. Nothing.

Prince Zuko,
the Avatar is the only one

who can stop the Fire Nation

from winning this war.

If you have an ounce of loyalty left,

you'll tell me what you found.

I haven't found anything.

It's like you said...

The Avatar probably died
a long time ago.

Come on, uncle. We're going.

MAN: Commander Zhao,

we interrogated the crew
as you instructed.

They confirmed Prince Zuko

had the Avatar in custody

but let him escape.

Now remind me,

how exactly was your ship damaged?

So where do I get something to eat?

You're lucky enough
to be one of the first outsiders

to ever visit an airbender temple,

and all you can think about is food?

SOKKA: I'm just a simple guy
with simple needs.

So that's where my friends and I

would play airball,

and over there is where
the bison would sleep.

And...

[SIGH]

What's wrong?

This place used to be full of monks
and lemurs and bison.

Now there's just a bunch of weeds.

I can't believe how much
things have changed.

SOKKA: So, uh,

this airball game... How do you play?

Ugh!

Ooh!

Ha ha ha!

Aang seven, Sokka zero.

Making him feel better

is putting me in a world of hurt.

Katara, check this out.

Fire Nation.

We should tell him.

Aang, there's something
you need to see.

OK.

Oh!

What is it?

Uh... Just a new
waterbending move I learned.

Nice one. But enough practicing.

We have a whole temple to see.

You know,
you can't protect him forever.

Katara, firebenders were here.

You can't pretend they weren't.

I can for Aang's sake.

If he finds out that the Fire Nation
invaded his home,

he'll be devastated.

AANG: Hey, guys!

I want you to meet somebody.

Who's that?

Monk Gyatso,

the greatest airbender in the world.

He taught me everything I know.

But the true secret
is in the gooey center.

Hmm.

My ancient cake making technique

isn't the only thing on your mind,

is it, Aang?

This whole Avatar thing...

Maybe the monks made a mistake.

The only mistake they made

was telling you before you turned 16.

But we can't concern ourselves
with what was.

We must act on what is.

But, Gyatso,

how do I know if I'm ready for this?

Your questions will be answered

when you're old enough
to enter the air temple sanctuary.

Inside, you will meet someone

who will guide you on your journey.

Who is it?

When you are ready,

he will reveal himself to you.

Hmm.

Now...

Are you going to help me
with these cakes

or not?

All right.

One... Two...

Three.

[LEMURS CHATTERING]

[LAUGHING]

Your aim has improved greatly,

my young pupil.

You must miss him.

Yeah.

Where are you going?

The air temple sanctuary.

There's someone I'm ready to meet.

KATARA: But, Aang,

no one could have survived in there

for a hundred years.

It's not impossible.

I survived in the iceberg
for that long.

Good point.

Katara, whoever's in there

might help me figure out
this Avatar thing.

And whoever's in there
might have a medley

of delicious cured meats.

Ooh!

Unh!

Ohh.

I don't suppose you have a key.

The key, Sokka, is airbending.

Hello?

Anyone home?

ZHAO: So a 12-year-old boy

bested you and your firebenders.

You're more pathetic than I thought.

I underestimated him once,

but it will not happen again.

No, it will not,

because you won't
have a second chance.

Commander Zhao,

I've been hunting the Avatar
for two years, and I...

And you failed.

Capturing the Avatar is too important

to leave in a teenager's hands.

He's mine now.

[YELLS]

Keep them here.

More tea, please.

Statues?

That's it?

Where's the meat?

Who are all these people?

I'm not sure.

But it feels like I know them somehow.

Look!

That one's an airbender!

And this one's a waterbender.

They're lined up in a pattern.

Air, water, earth, and fire.

That's the Avatar cycle.

Of course. They're Avatars.

All these people
are your past lives, Aang.

Wow! There's so many.

Past lives?

Katara, you really
believe in that stuff?

It's true.

When the Avatar dies,

he's reincarnated
into the next nation in the cycle.

Aang, snap out of it.

Huh?

Who is that?

That's Avatar Roku,
the Avatar before me.

You were a firebender?

No wonder I didn't trust you
when we first met.

There's no writing.

How do you know his name?

I'm not sure.

I just know it somehow.

[GRUNT]

You just couldn't get any weirder.

[WHISPERING] Firebender.
Nobody make a sound.

You're making a sound.

Shh! Shh!

That firebender
won't know what hit him.

[CHATTERING]

Lemur!

Dinner.

Don't listen to him.

You're gonna be my new pet.

Not if I get him first!

AANG: Wait! Come back!

SOKKA: I want to eat you!

Ha ha ha!

Aah! Unh!

[LAUGHING]

Hey! No fair!

My search party is ready.

Once I'm out to sea,

my guards will escort you
back to your ship,

And you will be free to go.

Why? Are you worried

I'm going to try and stop you?

Ha ha ha!

You... Stop me?

Impossible.

Don't underestimate me, Zhao.

I will capture the Avatar before you.

Prince Zuko, that's enough.

You can't compete with me.

I have hundreds of warships
under my command,

And you,

you're just a banished prince.

No home, no allies.

Your own father doesn't even want you.

You're wrong.

Once I deliver
the Avatar to my father,

he will welcome me home with honor

and restore my rightful place
on the throne.

If your father really wanted you home,

he would have let you return by now,

Avatar or no Avatar.

But in his eyes, you are a failure

and a disgrace to the Fire Nation.

That's not true.

You have the scar to prove it.

Aah! Maybe you'd like one to match!

Is that a challenge?

An Agni Kai at sunset.

Very well.

It's a shame your father won't be here

to watch me humiliate you.

I guess your uncle will do.

Prince Zuko,

have you forgotten what happened

the last time you dueled a master?

I will never forget.

[CHATTERING]

Hey! Come back!

Come on out, little lemur.

That hungry guy
won't bother you anymore.

Firebenders?

They were here?

Gyatso.

Hey, Aang, you find my dinner yet?

[SOBBING]

Aang, I wasn't really gonna
eat the lemur, OK?

Oh, man.

Come on, Aang.

Everything will be all right.

Let's get out of here.

[GASP]

Aang!

Send word
to the Fire Lord immediately.

The Avatar has returned.

SOKKA: Aang, come on!

Snap out of it! Aah!

Aah! Unh!

What happened?

He found out firebenders
killed Gyatso.

Oh, no. It's his Avatar spirit.

He must have triggered it.

I'm gonna try and calm him down.

Well, do it,

before he blows us off the mountain!

Remember your firebending basics,
Prince Zuko.

They are your greatest weapons.

I refuse to let him win.

This will be over quickly.

[YELLS]

[PANTING]

[YELLING]

Basics, Zuko.

Break his root.

Unh!

Unh!

[GROAN]

[YELLING]

Aah!

Unh!

Do it!

That's it?

Your father raised a coward.

Next time you get in my way,
I promise,

I won't hold back.

[YELLING]

Unh!

No, Prince Zuko.

Do not taint your victory.

So this is how
the great Commander Zhao

acts in defeat?

Disgraceful.

Even in exile,

my nephew is more honorable than you.

Thanks again for the tea.

It was delicious.

Did you really mean that, uncle?

Of course.

I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.

KATARA: Aang, I know you're upset,

and I know how hard it is

to lose the people you love.

I went through the same thing
when I lost my mom.

Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders

may be gone,

but you still have a family.

Sokka and I, we're your family now.

Katara and I

aren't gonna let anything
happen to you.

Promise.

[SIGH]

I'm sorry.

It's OK.

It wasn't your fault.

But you were right.

And if firebenders found this temple,

That means
they found the other ones, too.

I really am the last airbender.

Everything's packed.

You ready to go?

How is Roku supposed to help me

if I can't talk to him?

Maybe you'll find a way.

[CHOMPING]

Mm! Mm!

Looks like you made
a new friend, Sokka.

Can't talk. Must eat.

Hey, little guy.

[CHATTERS]

You, me, and Appa...

We're all that's left of this place.

We have to stick together.

Katara, Sokka,

say hello to the newest
member of our family.

What are you gonna name him?

Momo.

[LAUGHTER]

The only reason you should be interrupting
me is if you have news about the Avatar.

Well, there is news, Prince Zuko, but you
might not like it. Don't get too upset.

Uncle, you taught me that keeping a
level head is a sign of a great leader.

Now whatever you have to say,
I'm sure that I can take it.

Okay, then... we have
no idea where he is.

What?!

You really should open
a window in here.

Give me the map!

Ah, There have been multiple
sightings of the Avatar...

but he is impossible
to track down.


 


How am I gonna find him, Uncle?

He is clearly a master
of evasive maneuvering.

You have no idea where
you're going, do you?

Well, I know
it's near water...

I guess we're
getting close then.

Momo, marbles please.

Hey Katara! Check out
this airbending trick!

That's great, Aang.

You didn't even look.

That's great!

But I'm not doing it now.

Stop bugging her, airhead. You need to give
girls space when they do their sewing.

What does me being a girl
have to do with sewing?

Simple, girls are better at
fixing pants than guys...

and guys are better at hunting and
fighting and stuff like that.

It's just the natural
order of things.

All done with your pants! And
look what a great job I did!

Wait! I was just kidding! I can't
wear these! Katara, please!

Relax, Sokka. Where we're going,
you won't need any pants!

We just made a pit
stop yesterday.

Shouldn't we get a little more
flying done before we camp out?

He's right. At this rate we won't
get to the North Pole until spring.

But Appa's tired already, aren't you boy?
I said, aren't you boy?

Yeah, that was real convincing. Still, hard
to argue with a ten ton magical monster.

Look!

That's why we're here...

elephant koi. And I'm going to ride it.
Katara, you've gotta watch me!

Cold!

He looks pretty good out there.

Are you kidding? The fish
is doing all the work.

No, Appa! Don't eat that!

Aww, man...

There's something in the water!

What's wrong?

Aang's in trouble. Aang!

Get out of there!

- Come back here! Aang!
- Aang

What was that thing?

I don't know.

Well, let's not stick around and find out.
Time to hit the road.

Or we could stay a while...

You three have some
explaining to do.

And if you don't answer
all our questions...

we're throwing you back in
the water with the unagi.

Show yourselves, cowards!

Who are you? Where are
the men who ambushed us?

There were no men.
We ambushed you.

Now tell us, who are you and
what are you doing here?

Wait a second, there's no way that
a bunch of girls took us down.

A bunch of girls, huh? The
unagi's gonna eat well tonight.

No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it.
My brother is just an idiot sometimes.

It's my fault. I'm sorry we came here.
I wanted to ride the elephant koi.

How do we know you're
not Fire Nation spies?

Kyoshi stayed out of the war so far.
And we intend to keep it that way!

This island is named for Kyoshi?
I know Kyoshi!

Ha! How could you
possibly know her?

Avatar Kyoshi was born here four hundred
years ago. She's been dead for centuries.

I know her because
I'm the Avatar.

That's impossible!

The last Avatar was an airbender who
disappeared a hundred years ago.

That's me!

Throw the imposter to the unagi!

Aang... do some airbending...

It's true... you are the Avatar!

Now... check this out!

Did you hear the news?
The Avatar's on Kyoshi!

Huh?

The Avatar's on Kyoshi Island?

Uncle, ready the rhinos. He's not
getting away from me this time.

Are you going to finish that?

I was going to
save it for later!

All right! Dessert for breakfast! These
people sure know how to treat an Avatar!

Mmm... Katara you've
got to try these!

Well, maybe just a bite...

Sokka, what's your problem? Eat!

Not hungry.

But you're always hungry!

He's just upset because a bunch of
girls kicked his butt yesterday.

They snuck up on me!

Right. And then they
kicked your butt.

Sneak attacks don't count!

Tie me up with ropes! I'll show them a
thing or two. I'm not scared of any girls.

Who do they think they are anyway?
Mmm... this is tasty.

What's he so angry about? It's great here.
They're giving us the royal treatment.

Hey, don't get too comfortable. It's risky
for us to stay in one place for very long.

I'm sure we'll be fine. Besides, did you
see how happy I'm making this town?

They're even cleaning up
that statue in my honor!

Well, it's nice to see you
excited about being the Avatar.

I just hope it doesn't
all go to your head.

Come on, you know me better than that.
I'm just a simple monk.

Painting the Avatar...
that's easy enough...

Oh... there's another one... I'll
make an adjustment here, and...

There's more... what...

Sorry ladies! Didn't mean to
interrupt your dance lesson.

I was just looking for somewhere
to get a little workout?

Well, you're in the right place.

Sorry about yesterday. I didn't know
that you were friends with the Avatar.

It's all right. I mean,
normally I'd hold a grudge...

but seeing as you guys are a bunch
of girls, I'll make an exception.

I should hope so. A big strong man
like you? We wouldn't stand a chance.

True. But don't feel bad. After all,
I'm the best warrior in my village.

Wow! Best warrior, huh?
In your whole village?

Maybe you'd be kind enough to
give us a little demonstration.

Oh... well... I mean... I...

Come on, girls! Wouldn't you
like him to show us some moves?

Well, if that's what you want, I'd be happy
to. All right, you stand over there. Now.

This may be a little tough,
but try to block me.

Heh heh... good. Of course,
I was going easy on you.

Of course.

Let's see if you
can handle this!

That does it!

Anything else you
want to teach us?

There she is, girls.
Me in a past life.

You were pretty!

Excuse me for a second, ladies.

Oh, good! Can you help me carry this
back to the room? It's a little heavy.

Actually, I can't right now.

What do you mean you can't?

I promised the girls that I'd
give them a ride on Appa.

Why don't you come with us?
It'll be fun!

Watching you show off for a bunch
of girls does not sound like fun.

Well, neither does
carrying your basket.

It's not my basket. These
supplies are for our trip.

I told you, we have
to leave Kyoshi soon.

I don't want to
leave Kyoshi yet.

I can't put my finger on it, but there's
something I really like about this place.

What's taking you
so long, Aangy?

Aangy...

Just a second, Koko!

"Simple monk," huh?

I thought you promised me that this
Avatar stuff wouldn't go to your head.

It didn't. You
know what I think?

You just don't want to come
because you're jealous.

Jealous? Of what?

Jealous that we're having
so much fun without you.

That's ridiculous.

It is a little ridiculous,
but I understand.

Uh... hey, Suki.

Hoping for another dance lesson?

No... I... well, let me explain.

Spit it out! What do you want?

I would be honored if
you would teach me.

Even if I'm a girl?

I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier.
I was wrong.

We normally don't teach
outsiders, let alone boys.

Please make an exception.
I won't let you down.

All right. But you have to
follow all of our traditions.

Of course!

And I mean all of them.

Do I really have to wear this?
It feels a little... girly.

It's a warrior's uniform.
You should be proud.

The silk threads symbolizes the brave
blood that flows through our veins.

The gold insignia represents the
honor of the warrior's heart.

Bravery and honor.

Hey Sokka! Nice dress!

Katara, remember how the unagi
almost got me yesterday?

Yeah.

Well, I'm gonna go ride it now.
It's gonna be real dangerous.

Good for you.

You're not going to stop me?

Nope. Have fun.

I will.

Great.

I know it's great.

I'm glad you know.

I'm glad you're glad.

- Good!
- Fine!

You're not going to master it in one day.
Even I'm not that good.

I think I'm starting to get it.

It's not about strength.

Our technique is about using your
opponents' force against them. Loosen up.

Think of the fan as an
extension of your arm.

Wait for an opening and then...

I fell on purpose to
make you feel better!

I got you! Admit I got you!

Okay, it was a lucky shot. Let's
see if you can do it again.

What's taking so long?

I'm sure it will be
here any second!

Um... What about this?

Not that again. Boring.

Where's the unagi?
It's getting late.

Where're you going? Don't leave!

Sorry, Aang! Maybe next time.

Katara! You show up!

I wanted to make sure you were safe.
You really had me worried.

Back there you acted
like you didn't care.

I'm sorry.

Me too. I did let all that attention
go to my head. I was being a jerk.

Well, get out of the water before
you catch a cold, you big jerk!

On my way!

Hang on, Aang!

Aang...!

Zuko!

I want the Avatar alive.

Wake up, Aang!

Katara...

don't ride the unagi. Not fun.

Not bad.

Firebenders have landed on our shores!
Girls, come quickly!

Hey, I'm not a... oh, whatever!

Come out, Avatar! You can't
hide from me forever!

Find him.

I guess training's over.

Nice try, Avatar! But these
little girls can't save you.

Hey! Over here!

Finally!

Get inside.

Look what I brought
to this place.

It's not your fault.

Yes, it is. These people got their
town destroyed trying to protect me.

Then let's get out of here. Zuko
will leave Kyoshi to follow us.

I know it feels wrong to run,
but I think it's the only way.

I'll call Appa.

There's no time to say goodbye.

What about, "I'm sorry"?

For what?

I treated you like a girl when I should
have treated you like a warrior.

I am a warrior. But
I'm a girl, too.

Now get out of here!
We'll hold them off.

Appa, yip yip!

Back to the ship! Don't
lose sight of them!

I know it's hard, but you
did the right thing.

Zuko would have destroyed the
whole place if we had stayed.

They're going to be okay, Aang.

What are you doing?!

Thank you, Avatar.

I know, I know. That was
stupid and dangerous.

Yes, it was.

The Earth Kingdom
city of Omashu!

I used to always come here
to visit my friend, Bumi.

Wow. We don't have cities
like this in the South Pole.

They have buildings
here that don't melt!

Well, let's go slow pokes! The
real fun is inside the city!

Wait, Aang! It could be dangerous if
people find out you're the Avatar.

You need a disguise.

So, what am I supposed to do?
Grow a mustache?

Ohh, so itchy! How do
you live in this stuff?

Great! Now you look just
like my grandfather.


 


Technically, Aang
is 112 years old.

Now let's get to skippin', young
whippersnappers! The big city awaits.

You guys are gonna love Omashu. The people
here are the friendliest in the world.

Rotten cabbages! What kind of
slum do you think this is?

Noo! My cabbages!

Just keep smiling...

State your business!

My business is my business,
young man, and none of yours!

I've got half a mind to bend you over
my knee and paddle your backside!

Settle down, old timer.
Just tell me who you are.

Name's Bonzu Pipinpadaloxicopolis, the
Third, and these are my grandkids.

Hi, June Pipinpadaloxicopolis.
Nice to meet you.

You seem like a
responsible young lady.

See that your grandfather stays
out of trouble. Enjoy Omashu!

We will.

Wait a minute!

You're a strong young boy.

Show some respect for the elderly
and carry your grandfather's bag.

Good idea!

This is the Omashu delivery system.
Miles and miles of tubes and chutes.

Earthbending brings the packages
up and gravity brings them down.

Great, so they get
their mail on time.

They do get their
mail on time...

but my friend Bumi found a
better use for these chutes...

Look around you,
what do you see?

Umm... the mail system?

Instead of seeing what
they want you to see...

you gotta open your brain
to the possibilities.

A package sending system?

The world's greatest
super slide!

Bumi, you're a mad genius!

One ride, then we're off to the
North Pole, Airbender's honor.

This sounded like fun at first,
but now that I'm here...

I'm starting to have
second thoughts!

I'm on it!

Men, you'll be going
off to combat soon.

It's important that you
be prepared for anything.

Aang, do something!
Use your airbending!

Yeh! Good idea! That'll
make us go even faster!

Sorry!

My cabbages! You're
gonna pay for this!

Two cabbages please.

Your majesty, these juveniles
were arrested for vandalism...

traveling under false pretenses and
malicious destruction of cabbages.

Off with their heads! One
for each head of cabbage!

Silence! Only the King can pass down
judgment. What is your judgment, Sire?

Throw them... a feast!

Huh?

The people in my city have gotten
fat from too many feasts...

so I hope you like your
chicken with no skin.

Thanks, but I don't eat meat.

How about you? I
bet you like meat.

Is it just me, or is this
guy's crown a little crooked?

So, tell me young bald one.
Where are you from?

I'm from... Kangaroo Island.

Oh, Kangaroo Island, eh? I hear
that place is really hoppin!

What? It was pretty funny.

Well, all these good jokes are making
me tired. Guess it's time to the hay.

There's an airbender in our presence and
not just any airbender, the Avatar!

Now what do you have to say for
yourself, Mr. Pipinpadaloxicopolis?

Okay! You caught me. I'm the Avatar, doing
my Avatar thing, keeping the world safe.

Everything checks out, no firebenders here.
So, good work everybody.

Love each other, respect all life
and don't run with your spears.

We'll see you next time!

You can't keep us here.
Let us leave.

Lettuce leaf?

We're in serious trouble.
This guy is nuts.

Tomorrow the Avatar will face
three deadly challenges.

But for now, the guards will
show you to your chamber.

My liege, do you mean the good
chamber, or the bad chamber?

The newly refurbished chamber.

Wait, which one are
we talking about?

The one that used to be the bad chamber,
until the recent refurbishing that is.

Of course, we've been calling it the new
chamber, but we really should number them.

Uh, take them to the refurbished
chamber that was once bad!

This is a prison cell?
But it's so nice.

He did say it was
newly refurbished.

Nice or not, we're prisoners.

I wonder what these
challenges are gonna be.

We're not sticking around to find out.
There's gotta be some way outta here.

The air vents!

If you think we're gonna fit through there
then you're crazier then that king.

We can't, but Momo can.

Momo, I need you to find
Appa and bust us outta here!

Go on, boy, get Appa!

Eh, how was Appa supposed
to save us anyway?

Appa is a ten ton flying bison, I
think he could figure something out.

Well, no point in arguing about it now.
Get some rest, Aang.

Looks like you'll
need it for tomorrow.

Sokka! Katara! Where
are my friends?

The King will free them if you
complete your challenges.

And if I fail?

He didn't say.
Your staff please?

First, Avatar, what do you think of my
new outfit? I want your honest opinion.

I'm waiting.

I... guess it's fine.

Excellent! You passed
the first test.

Really?

Well, not one of the deadly tests. The real
challenges are much more... challenging.

I don't have time for your crazy games!
Gimme my friends back! We're leaving!

Ohh, I thought you
might refuse...

so I will give your friends
some special souvenirs.

Those delightful rings are made of pure
genemite, also known as creeping crystal.

It's crystal that grows
remarkably fast.

By nightfall your friends will
be completely covered in it.

Terrible fate, really. I can stop
it, but only if you cooperate.

Ah! It's already creeping!

I'll do as you want.

It seems I've lost my lunch
box key and I'm hungry.

Ooo, there it is. Would you
mind fetching it for me?

Ooo, climbing the ladder. No
one's thought of that before.

That's right. Keep diving head in,
I'm sure it'll work eventually.

There, enjoy your lunch! I
want my friends back, now!

Uh, not yet. I need help with another
matter. It seems I've lost my pet Flopsy.

Okay, found him!

Bring him to me! Daddy
wants a kiss from Flopsy!

Come here, Flopsy!

Flopsy, wait! Flopsy!

Flopsy!

Wait a minute?

Flopsy?

Flopsy!

Awww, that's a good boy!
Yes, who has a soft belly?

Guys, are you okay?

Other than the crystal slowly
encasing my entire body, doing great.

Awww, yes.

Come on. I'm ready for
the next challenge.

Your final test is a duel and as a special
treat you may choose your opponent.

Point and choose.

So, you're saying whoever I point to,
that's the person I get to fight?

Choose wisely.

I... choose...

you!

Wrong choice!

You thought I was a
frail old man...

but I'm the most powerful
earthbender you'll ever see.

Can I fight the guy
with the axe instead?

There are no... take-back-sees' in
my kingdom. You might need this!

Typical airbender tactic,
avoid and evade.

I'd hoped the Avatar would
be less predictable.

Don't you have any surprises for me? Sooner
or later, you'll have to strike back.

Oh, you'll have to be a little
more creative than that!

Did someone leave the windows open?
It feels a little drafty in here!

Are you hoping
I'll catch a cold?

How are you going to get
me from way over there?

Hehe! Well done, Avatar. You fight
with much fire in your heart.

Huh?

You've passed all my tests. Now,
you must answer one question.

That's not fair! You said you would release
my friends if I finished your tests.

Oh, but what's the point of tests
if you don't learn anything?

Oh come on!

Answer this one question and I will set
your friends free. What... is my name?

From the looks of your friends, I'd
say you only have a few minutes.

How am I supposed
to know his name?

Think about the challenges,
maybe it's some kind of riddle.

I got it!

Yeh?

He's an earthbender, right? Rocky!
You know, because of all the rocks?

We're gonna keep trying,
but that is a good backup.

Okay, so back to the challenges.
I got a key from the waterfall.

I saved his pet
and I had a duel.

And what did you learn?

Well, everything was
different than I expected.

And...?

Well, they weren't
straightforward.

To solve each test, I had to think differently
than I usually would. I know his name!

I solved the question the same
way I solved the challenges.

As you said a long time ago, I had to
open my brain to the possibilities.

Bumi, you're a mad genius!

Oh, Aang. It's good to see you. You
haven't changed a bit. Literally.

Uh, over here!

Little help?

Genemite is made of rock candy.
Delicious!

So this crazy king is
your old friend, Bumi?

Who you calling old?
Okay. I'm old.

Why did you do all this instead of
just telling Aang who you were?

First of all, it's pretty fun messing with
people, hehe, but I do have a reason.

Aang, you have a
difficult task ahead.

The world has changed in the
hundred years you've been gone.

It's the duty of the Avatar to restore balance
to the world by defeating Fire Lord Ozai.

You have much to learn.

You must master the four elements and
confront the Fire Lord, and when you do...

I hope you will think
like a mad genius!

And it looks like
you're in good hands.

You'll need your friends to
help defeat the Fire Nation.

And you'll need Momo too.

Thank you for your wisdom. But before
we leave, I have a challenge for you!

My cabbages!

[BIRDS SINGING]

[MOMO CHATTERING]

Great. You're back. What's for dinner?

We've got a few options.

First, round nuts and some kind of
oval-shaped nuts.

And some rock-shaped nuts
that might just be rocks.

Dig in.

Seriously, what else you got?

[PURRING]

[BOOM]

SOKKA: What was that?

[BOOM]

AANG: It's coming from over there.


 


SOKKA: Shouldn't we run away from
huge booms, not toward them?

[PURRING]

Hyah.

An earthbender.

Let's go meet him.

He looks dangerous,
so we better approach cautiously.

Hello there! I'm Katara.

What's your name?

Ah!

AANG: Nice to meet you!

I just wanted to say hi.

Hey, that guy's
got to be running somewhere.

Maybe we're near a village.

And I bet that village has a market.

Which means no nuts for dinner.

Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts.

[PURRING]

Yeah, I hate them, too.

AANG: Great hat.

I'll trade you some nuts for it.

Hey!

Hi, Mom.

Where have you been, Haru?

You're late!

Get started on your chores.

Hey! You're that kid.

Ah!

Why did you run away before?

Uh... You must have me confused
with some other kid.

No, she doesn't.
We saw you earthbending.

They saw you doing what?

They're crazy, Mom.

I mean, look at how they're dressed.

You know how dangerous that is.

You know what would happen
if they caught you earthbending.

MAN: Open up!

[LOUD KNOCKING]

SOKKA: Fire Nation. Act natural.

Aah!

What do you want?
I've already paid you this week.

The tax just doubled.

We wouldn't want an accident,
would we?

Fire is sometimes so hard to control.

You can keep the copper ones.

Nice guy.

How long has
the Fire Nation been here?

Five years. Fire Lord Ozai

uses our town's coal mines
to fuel his ships.

They're thugs. They steal from us.

And everyone here
is too much of a coward

to do anything about it.

Quiet, Haru!

Don't talk like that!

But Haru's an earthbender.

He can help.

Earthbending is forbidden.

It's caused nothing
but misery for this village.

He must never use his abilities.

How can you say that?

Haru has a gift.

Asking him not to earthbend

is like asking me not to waterbend.

It's a part of who we are.

You don't understand.

I understand that Haru can help
you fight back.

What can the Fire Nation do to you

that they haven't done already?

They could take Haru away,

like they took his father.

HARU: My mom said
you can sleep here tonight.

But you should leave in the morning.

Thanks. I'll make sure
Appa doesn't eat all your hay.

KATARA: I'm sorry about
what I said earlier.

I didn't know about your father.

HARU: That's OK.

It's funny. The way you were talking
back in the store,

it reminded me of him.

Thanks.

My father was very courageous.

When the Fire Nation invaded,

he and the other earthbenders
were outnumbered ten to one.

But they fought back anyway.

He sounds like a great man.

After the attack,
they rounded up my father

and every other earthbender

and took them away.
We haven't seen them since.

So that's why
you hide your earthbending.

Yeah.

The problem is,

the only way I can feel close
to my father now

is when I practice my bending.

He taught me everything I know.

See this necklace?

My mother gave it to me.

It's beautiful.

I lost my mother
in a Fire Nation raid.

This necklace is all
I have left of her.

It's not enough, is it?

No.

Aah! Help!

The mine!

Aah...

Help me!

[MOANING]

[RUMBLING]

Ah! It's not working.

We have to get help.

There's no time. Pull harder!

Haru, there's a way you can help him.

I can't.

Please. There's no one around
to see you.

It's the only way!

Ah!

Haru, you did it!

[PURRING]

It was so brave of Haru
to use his earthbending

to help that old man.

You must have really inspired him.

I guess so.

Everyone should get some sleep.

We're leaving at dawn.

Dawn? Can't we sleep in for once?

Absolutely not!

This village is crawling
with Fire Nation troops.

If they discover you're here, Aang,

we'll be eating fireballs
for breakfast.

Good night.

I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.

Good night.

[LAUGHING]

Ah!

That's him!

That's the earthbender!

Aah!

They took him!

-They took Haru away!
-What?

The old man turned him in
to the Fire Nation.

It's all my fault.
I forced him into earthbending.

Slow down, Katara.
When did this happen?

Haru's mother said
they came for him at midnight.

Then it's too late to track him.
He's long gone.

We don't need to track him.

The Fire Nation is going to
take me right to Haru.

And why would they do that?

Because they're going to arrest me
for earthbending.

I thought you were
crazy at first, Katara,

but this might work.

There are ventilation shafts
throughout these mines.

All Aang has to do is
send an air current

from that vent to this one right here.

The boulder levitates and ta-da...

Fake earthbending.

Aang, did you get all that?

Sure, sure. I got it.

Do you remember your cue?

Yeah, yeah. Just relax.

You're taking all the fun out of this.

By "this" do you mean
intentionally being captured

by an army of ruthless firebenders?

Exactly. That's fun stuff.

SOKKA: Here they come.
Get in your places.

Uh! Get out of my way, pipsqueak.

How dare you call me pipsqueak,
you giant-eared cretin?

What did you call me?

A giant-eared cretin.

Look at those things.

Do herds of animals
use them for shade?

You better back off!

Seriously, back off.

I will not back off!

I bet elephants get together

and make fun of
how large your ears are.

That's it! You're going down.

I'll show you who's boss,

earthbending style.

I said, "earthbending style!"

That lemur. He's earthbending.

No, you idiot. It's the girl.

Oh. Of course.

I'll hold her!

[WHISPERING] You've got 12 hours
to find Haru.

We'll be right behind you.

Momo, you have some big ears.

[PURRING]

She'll be fine, Aang.
Katara knows what she's doing.

MAN: Earthbenders,
it is my pleasure to welcome you

aboard my modest shipyard.

I am your warden.

I prefer to think of you
not as prisoners,

but as honored guests.

And I hope you come to think of me

as your humble and caring host.

You will succeed here
if you simply abide...

[COUGHING]

Hyah!

What kind of guest dishonors his host
by interrupting him?

Take him below.

One week in solitary
will improve his manners.

Simply treat me with the courtesy
I give you

and we'll get along famously.

You will notice, earthbenders,

that this rig is made
entirely of metal.

You are miles away
from any rock or earth.

So, if you have any illusions
about employing

that brutish savagery
that passes for bending

among you people, forget them.

It is impossible.

Good day.

Katara?

Haru!

What are you doing here?

It's my fault you were captured.

I came to rescue you.

So you got yourself arrested?

It was the only way to find you.

You've got guts, Katara.
I'll give you that.

Come on. There's someone
I want you to meet.

Katara, this is my father, Tyro.

Dad, this is Katara.

It's an honor to meet you.

Have some dinner, Katara.

Ew.

It's not as bad as it looks.

Eew!

It's still pretty bad, though.

Tyro, the prisoners are complaining

there aren't enough blankets
to go around.

I'll talk to the guards.

In the meantime, make sure
the elderly are taken care of.

The rest of us will simply have to
hope for warmer weather.

If you don't mind me asking,

what's your escape plan?

Excuse me?

You know, the plan
to get everyone off the rig?

What is it? Mutiny, sabotage?

The plan? The plan is to survive,

wait out this war, hope that one day

some of us can get back home
and forget this ever happened.

How can you say that?

You sound like
you've already given up.

Katara, I admire your courage.

And I envy your youth.

But people's lives are at stake here.

The warden is a ruthless man,

and he won't stand for any rebellion.

I'm sorry, but we're powerless.

We'll see about that.

Earthbenders!

You don't know me, but I know of you.

Every child in my water tribe village
was rocked to sleep

with stories of the brave
Earth Kingdom

and the courageous earthbenders
who guard its borders.

Some of you may think
that the Fire Nation

has made you powerless.

Yes. They have taken away
your ability to bend.

But they can't take away your courage.

And it is your courage
they should truly fear,

because it runs deeper than any mine

you've been forced to dig,

any ocean that keeps you
far from home.

It is the strength of your hearts

that make you who you are,

hearts that will remain unbroken
when all rock and stone

has eroded away.

The time to fight back is now!

I can tell you
the Avatar has returned!

So remember your courage,
earthbenders!

Let us fight for our freedom!

[MAN COUGHING]

Ah!

Shh.

Your 12 hours are up. Where is Haru?

We've got to get out of here.

I can't.

We don't have much time.
There are guards everywhere.

Get on!

Katara, what's wrong?

I'm not leaving.

I'm not giving up on these people.

SOKKA: What do you mean,
you're not leaving?

We can't abandon these people.

There has to be a way to help them.

Maybe she's right.
What do you say, Sokka?

I say you're both crazy.

Last chance. We need to leave now.

No.

I hate when you get like this.

Come on, we better hide.

[WHISPERING] Go.

Look!

Tell me exactly what you saw.

Well, sir, it looked like
a flying bison.

What?

It was a giant, flying buffalo, sir,

with an empty saddle.

Which was it, a buffalo or a bison?

I'm not sure what the difference is,

but that's not really the point,
is it, sir?

I'll decide what the point is, fool!

Aah!

[SPLASH]

You! Wake up the captain!
Search the entire rig!

-Sir.
-What?

That was the captain
you just threw overboard, so...

Then wake up someone
I haven't thrown overboard

and search the rig.

There's something going on here,
and I don't like it.

[PURRING]

We don't have much time.
What are we gonna do?

I wish I knew how to make a hurricane.

The warden would run away,
and we would steal his keys.

Wouldn't he just
take his keys with him?

I'm just tossing ideas around.

I tried talking the earthbenders

into fighting back,
but it didn't work.

If there was just a way
to help them help themselves.

For that they need some kind of
earth or some rock,

something they can bend.

But this entire place
is made of metal.

No, it's not. Look at the smoke.

I bet they're burning coal.

In other words...

Earth.

It's almost dawn.
We're running out of time.

You sure this is gonna work?

It should.

These vents reminded me
of our little trick

back at the village.

We're gonna do the same thing,
but on a much bigger scale.

There's a huge deposit of coal
at the base of this island.

And the whole system is ventilated.

Aang closed off
all the vents except one.

When he does his airbending,

the coal only has one place to go...

Right back here.

MAN: There's the intruder!

Stay back! I'm warning you!

Katara, stop.
You can't win this fight.

Listen to him well, child.

You're one mistake away

from dying where you stand.

[COUGHING]

Here's your chance, earthbenders!

Take it!
Your fate is in your own hands!

[WARDEN LAUGHING]

Foolish girl.

You thought a few inspirational words

and some coal
would change these people?

Look at these blank hopeless faces.

Their spirits were broken
a long time ago.

Oh, but you still believed in them.

How sweet.

They're a waste of your energy,
little girl.

You failed.

Grr.

Hyah!

Show no mercy!

Aah!

For the Earth Kingdom,

attack!

[ALL YELLING]

[SCREAMING]

Get to the ship! We'll hold them off!

Do not let them escape!

Guys, throw me some coal!

No, please. I can't swim.

Don't worry. I hear cowards float.

[SCREAMING]

I want to thank you for saving me,

for saving us.

All it took was a little coal.

It wasn't the coal, Katara.

It was you.

Thank you for helping me
find my courage,

Katara of the water tribe.

My family and everyone here

owes you much.

So, I guess you're going home now.

Yes, to take back my village.

To take back all of our villages!

The Fire Nation will regret the day

they set foot on our land!

[CHEERING]

Come with us.

I can't.

Your mission
is to take back your home.

Ours is to get Aang to the North Pole.

That's him, isn't it? The Avatar.

Katara, thank you for bringing
my father back to me.

I never thought I'd see him again.

I only wish there was some way...

I know.

My mother's necklace! It's gone!

[SQUAWK]

[APPA GROWLING]

KATARA: Those clouds
look so soft, don't they?

Like you could just jump down

and you'd land in a big, soft,
cottony heap.

Maybe you should give it a try.

You're hilarious.


 


I'll try it!

Ha ha ha!

Yeah!

Turns out, clouds are made of water.

Hey, what is that?

It's like a scar.

SOKKA: Listen.

It's so quiet.

There's no life anywhere.

Aang, are you OK?

Fire Nation!

Those evil savages make me sick.

They have no respect for...

Shh.

What, I'm not allowed to be angry?

[SIGH]

Why would anyone do this?

How could I let this happen?

Aang, you didn't let this happen.

It has nothing to do with you.

Yes, it does.

It's the avatar's job
to protect nature,

but I don't know how to do my job.

That's why we're going
to the North Pole...

To find you a teacher.

Yeah. A waterbending teacher.

But there's no one who can
teach me how to be the Avatar.

Monk Gyatso said
that Avatar Roku would help me.

The Avatar before you?

He died over a hundred years ago.

How are you supposed to talk to him?

I don't know.

[PURRING]

Uncle, it's time to leave.

Where are you? Uncle Iroh!

Over here.

Uncle?

We need to move on.

We're closing in
on the Avatar's trail,

and I don't want to lose him.

You look tired, Prince Zuko.

Why don't you join me
in these hot springs

and soak away your troubles?

My troubles cannot be soaked away.

It's time to go!

You should take your teacher's advice

and relax a little.

The temperature's just right.

I heated it myself.

Enough. We need to leave now.

Get out of the water!

Very well.

On second thought,

why don't you take
another few minutes?

But be back at the ship
in half an hour,

or I'm leaving without you.

Ahh.

KATARA: Hey, Aang.

Are you ready to be cheered up?

No.

Ow!

Hey, how is that cheering me up?

[CHUCKLING]

Cheered me up.

Ow!

Yeah, I probably deserved that.

These acorns are everywhere, Aang.

That means the forest will grow back.

Every one of these will be
a tall oak tree someday,

and all the birds and animals

that lived here will come back.

Thanks, Katara.

[GASP]

SOKKA: Hey, who are you?

When I saw the flying bison,

I thought it was impossible,

but those markings...

Are you the Avatar, child?

My village
desperately needs your help.

This young person is the Avatar.

So the rumors of your return are true.

It is the greatest honor of a lifetime

to be in your presence.

Nice to meet you, too.

So, is there something
I can help you with?

I'm not sure.

Our village is in crisis.

He's our only hope.

For the last few days at sunset,

a spirit monster comes
and attacks our village.

He is Hei Bai,

the black and white spirit.

Why is it attacking you?

We do not know.

But each of the last three nights,

he has abducted one of our own.

We are especially fearful

because the winter solstice
draws near.

What happens then?

As the solstice approaches,

the natural world and the spirit world

grow closer and closer,

until the line between them

is blurred completely.

Hei Bai is already causing
devastation and destruction.

Once the solstice is here,

there is no telling what will happen.

So what do you want me to do exactly?

Who better to resolve a crisis

between our world and the spirit world

than the Avatar himself?

You are the great bridge

between man and spirits.

Right. That's me.

Hey, great bridge guy.

Can I talk to you over here
for a second?

Aang, you seem a little
unsure about all this.

Yeah. That might be because
I don't know anything at all

about the spirit world.

It's not like there's someone
to teach me this stuff.

So, can you help these people?

I have to try, don't I?

Maybe whatever I have to do
will just...

Come to me.

[PURRING]

I think you can do it, Aang.

Yeah.

We're all gonna get eaten
by a spirit monster.

[SNORING]

[RUSTLING]

Who's there?

[SQUEAKING]

A meadow vole.

I should have known.

You startled me, little one.

[SIGH]

Seems I dozed off and missed
my nephew's deadline,

but it was a very sweet nap.

[SQUEAKING]

[RUMBLING]

Uhh!

He's a Fire Nation soldier.

He's no ordinary soldier.

This is the Fire Lord's brother.

The Dragon of the West...

The once great General Iroh.

But now, he's our prisoner.

Hello? Spirit? Can you hear me?

This is the Avatar speaking.

I'm here to try to help stuff.

This isn't right.

We can't sit here and cower while Aang

waits for some monster to show up.

If anyone can save us, he can.

He still shouldn't have to
face this alone.

The sun is set.

Where are you, Hei Bai?

Well, spirit, uh,

I hereby ask you

to please leave this village in peace.

OK. Well, I guess
that's settled, then.

[VOICES WHISPERING]

You must be the Hei Bai spirit.
My name is...

[ROARS]

My name is Aang. I'm the avatar,

and I would like to help.

Hey, wait up!

[ROARING]

Uh...

The avatar's methods are...

Unusual.

It doesn't seem too interested

in what he's saying.

Maybe we should go help him.

No. Only the Avatar
stands a chance against the Hei Bai.

Aang will figure out
the right thing to do, Sokka.

Please, would you stop
destroying things and listen?

I'm just trying to do my job
as spirit bridge.

Excuse me.

Would you please turn around?

I command you to turn around now!

Uhh!

That's it. He needs help.

Sokka! Wait!

LEADER: It's not safe.

Hei Bai. Over here!

Sokka! Go back!

We'll fight him together, Aang.

I don't want to fight him unless I...

Sokka!

Uncle.

Uncle, where are you?

Sir, maybe he thought
you left without him.

Something's not right here.

That pile of rocks.

It looks like
there's been a landslide, sir.

Land doesn't slide uphill.

Those rocks didn't move naturally.

My uncle's been captured
by earthbenders.

[GASPING]

SOKKA: Aang! Over here!

Help!

Hang on, Sokka!

[GRUNTING]

Aah!

Uhh!

Sokka!

I've failed.

Where are you taking me?

We're taking you to face justice.

Right.

But where, specifically?

A place you're quite
familiar with, actually.

You once laid siege
to it for 600 days,

but it would not yield to you.

Ah, the great city of Ba Sing Se.

It was greater than
you were, apparently.

I acknowledge my defeat at Ba Sing Se.

After 600 days away from home,

my men were tired, and I was tired.

[YAWN]

And I'm still tired.

I'm sure they'll be back.

I know.

You should get some rest.

Everything's gonna be OK.

Your brother is in good hands.

I would be shocked

if the Avatar returned without him.

Katara? Katara, I lost him.

The sun is rising.

Perhaps he will return soon.

What? No. I'm right here.

Grr!

[GRUNTING]

I'm in the spirit world.

Ugh. Yep, that's Uncle Iroh.

AANG: I'll figure this out, Katara.
I promise.

Like they said, I'm the bridge

between the worlds, right?

All I have to do
is figure out what I have to do,

but once I do that, no problem.

[GROWLING]

Appa. Hey, buddy. I'm right here.

But I guess you can't see me, either.

[DULL ROAR]

It's OK, Appa. Don't worry.

I'm sure they're on their way back.

I bet they even found you
a bunch of moon peaches,

for a treat.

What am I supposed to do?

Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you?

Sokka?

[GROWLING]

That's definitely not Sokka.

Uhh!

What?

I can't airbend in the spirit world.

[GROWLING]

[GROWLING]

You don't know where Sokka is, do you?

[WHIMPERING]

You're Avatar Roku's animal guide,

like Appa is to me.

I need to save my friend,
and I don't know how.

Is there some way for me
to talk to Roku?

I'll be back, Katara.

Take me to Roku.

[GASP]

Oh.

What's the problem?

Nothing.

Actually, there is a bit of a problem.

My old joints
are feeling sore and achy,

and these shackles are too loose.

Too loose?

That's right. The cuffs are loose,

and they jangle around
and bump my wrists.

It would help me
if you would tighten them

so they wouldn't shake around so much.

Very well.

Corporal, tighten
the prisoner's handcuffs.

Aah!

Aah!

Aah!

AANG: Hey! What are you doing?!

Aah!

I don't understand.

This is just a statue of Roku.

Is that what Roku
wants to talk to me about?

A comet?

When can I talk to him?

[GROWLING]

It's a calendar,

and the light will reach Roku
on the solstice.

So that's when I'll be able
to speak to Roku?

[GROWLING]

But I can't wait that long.

I need to save Sokka now!

Ugh! Uhh!

Hyah!

He is too dangerous, captain.

We can't just carry him
to the capital.

We have to do something now.

I agree.

He must be dealt with immediately

and severely.

Ptoh!

KATARA: It's no use, Appa.
I don't see them anywhere.

Our best hope is to go back
to the village and wait.

[APPA GROWLS]

The Avatar.

Whoa.

Aah!

You're back!

Where's Sokka?

I'm not sure.

CAPTAIN: These dangerous hands
must be crushed.

[GRUNTING]

Hyah!

Hyah!

Excellent form, Prince Zuko.

You taught me well.

CAPTAIN: Surrender yourselves.

It's five against two.

You're clearly outnumbered.

Uh, that's true,

but you are clearly outmatched.

Hy... Ah!

Yah! Yah!

Hyah! Hyah!

[GRUNTING]

Hyah!

-Uhh!
-Uhh!

Uhh!

Uhh! Uhh!

Yah!

Oh!

[SOLDIERS GROANING]

Now, would you please
put on some clothes?

[VOICES WHISPERING]

[CHIMING]

Aah!

Aang! What are you doing?!

Run!

[ROARING]

[ROARING]

You're the spirit of this forest.

Now I understand.

You're upset and angry

because your home was burned down.

When I saw the forest had burned,

I was sad and upset,

but my friend gave me hope

that the forest would grow back.

Sokka!

What happened?

You were trapped in the spirit world
for 24 hours.

How are you feeling?

Like I seriously need
to use the bathroom.

Thank you, Avatar.

If only there were a way

to repay you for what you've done.

You could give us
some supplies and some money.

-Sokka.
-What?

We need stuff.

It would be an honor
to help you prepare for your journey.

I'm so proud of you, Aang.

You figured out what to do
all on your own.

Actually, I did have a little help.

And there's something else.

What is it?

I need to talk to Roku,

and I think I found a way

to contact his spirit.

-That's great.
-Creepy, but great.

There's a temple
on a crescent-shaped island,

and if I go there on the solstice,

I'll be able to speak with him.

But the solstice is tomorrow.

Yeah, and there's one more problem.

The island is in the Fire Nation.

Let's go, Appa! Come on, boy.

[GRUNTING]

Look, I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka

aren't coming
to the Fire Nation with us.

If they got hurt,
I'd never forgive myself.

So get your big butt
off the ground and let's go!

Uhh...

Aah!

SOKKA: I think his big butt

is trying to tell you something.


 


KATARA: Please don't go, Aang.

The world can't afford to lose you
to the Fire Nation.

Neither can I.

But I have to talk to Avatar Roku

to find out what my vision means.

I need to get to the fire temple

before the sun sets on the solstice.

That's today!

We're not letting you
go into the Fire Nation, Aang.

At least not without your friends.

We got your back.

Ew!

It's a long journey
to the crescent island.

You'll have to fly fast
to have any chance

of making it before sundown.

Good luck.

Thank you for your...

Go!

[GRUNT]

Ah.

Having trouble sleeping?

Uh!

Seen the Avatar lately?

Come on, boy.
We've got a long way to go.

Faster!

[GRUNT]

Sailing into Fire Nation waters.

Of all the foolish things you've done

in your 16 years, Prince Zuko,

this is the most foolish.

I have no choice, uncle.

Have you completely forgotten

that the Fire Lord banished you?

What if you're caught?

I'm chasing the Avatar.

My father will understand
why I'm returning home.

You give him too much credit.

My brother is not
the understanding type.

There they are.

Helmsman, full steam ahead.

Aang, we got trouble.

Yeah, and it's gaining fast!

Really, Prince Zuko,
couldn't you shoot them down

with something more fragrant?

Huh!

On my mark.

Fire!

Fire ball!

I'm on it!

We have to get out of Zuko's range

before he shoots
another hotsticker at us!

Can't you make Appa go any faster?

Yeah, but there's
just one little problem.

A blockade.

Technically, you are still

in Earth Kingdom waters.

Turn back now,
and they cannot arrest you.

If we fly north,

we can go around the Fire Nation ships

and avoid the blockade.

It's the only way.

KATARA: There's no time!

This is exactly why
I didn't want you to come.

It's too dangerous.

And that's exactly why we're here.

Let's run this blockade.

Appa, yip yip!

[APPA GRUNTS]

He's not turning around.

Please, Prince Zuko.
If the Fire Nation captures you,

There is nothing I can do.

Do not follow the Avatar.

I'm sorry, uncle.

Run the blockade!

ZHAO: The Avatar...

And the banished prince.

This must be my lucky day.

Commander Zhao, what are your orders?

Shoot the bison down, captain.

But there's a fire navy ship
out there, sir... One of our own.

What if it's hit?

So be it. It belongs to a traitor.

Ignite!

Launch!

Aah! Aah! Aah!

Appa, are you OK?

[GRUNT]

Prince Zuko, the engines are damaged!

We need to stop and make repairs!

Do not stop this ship.

Launch!

Aah!

[GRUNT]

Aah! Aah! Aah!

Aah!

Sokka!

Aah!

Aah!

Oh!

Ready.

Fire!

Aah!

Huh!

Aah! Ooh!

We made it!

We got into the Fire Nation. Great.

Where do you think
the Avatar is headed, sir?

I'm not sure,

but I bet a certain
banished prince will know.

We're on a collision course!

We can make it.

The boarding party is ready
to apprehend Prince Zuko, sir.

Wait. Cut the engines

and let them pass.

Sir?

[APPA SNORING]

There it is...

The island
where Roku's dragon took me.

You did it, buddy. Nice flying.

[SNORING]

Oh, you must be tired.

No, I'm good. Refreshed and ready
to fight some firebenders.

I was talking to Appa.

Well, I was talking to Momo.

SOKKA: I don't see any guards.

KATARA: The Fire Nation

must have abandoned the temple

when Avatar Roku died.

It's almost sundown.
We'd better hurry.

Wait. I think I heard something.

We are the fire sages,
guardians of the temple of the Avatar.

Great. I am the Avatar.

We know.

I'll hold them off. Run!

Uh! Uh! Uh!

If the Avatar contacts Roku,

there's no telling how powerful
the boy will become.

Split up and find him.

Follow me!

Do you know where you're going?

Nope.

Wrong way!

SHYU: Come back!

I don't want to fight you.
I am a friend.

Firebenders aren't our friends.

I know why you're here, Avatar.

You do?

Yes. You wish to speak to Avatar Roku.

I can take you to him.

How?

Uh!

This way.

MAN: Find him!

Time is running out! Quickly!

What's he up to, uncle?

Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?

Because he wants to follow you.

He knows you'll lead him

to the prize you're both after...

The Avatar.

If Zhao wants to follow
our trail of smoke,

then that's exactly
what I'll let him do.

SHYU: Avatar Roku once called
this temple his home.

He formed these secret passages
out of the magma.

AANG: Did you know Avatar Roku?

No, but my grandfather knew him.

Many generations of fire sages

guarded this temple long before me.

We all have a strong
spiritual connection

to this place.

Is that how you knew I was coming?

A few weeks ago,
an amazing thing occurred.

The statue of Avatar Roku...

Its eyes began to glow.

KATARA: That's when we were
at the air temple.

Avatar Roku's eyes
were glowing there, too.

At that moment,
we knew you had returned to the world.

If this is the Avatar's temple,

why did the sages attack me?

Things have changed.

In the past, the sages were loyal

only to the Avatar.

When Roku died, the sages eagerly
awaited for the next Avatar to return,

but he never came.

They were waiting for me.

Hey, don't feel bad.
You're only 100 years late.

They lost hope that the Avatar
would ever return.

When Fire Lord Sozin began the war,

my grandfather and the other sages

were forced to follow him.

I never wanted to serve the Fire Lord.

When I learned you were coming,

I knew I would have to
betray the other sages.

Thank you for helping me.

We'll follow these stairs
to the sanctuary.

Once you're inside,

wait for the light to hit
Avatar Roku's statue.

Only then will you be
able to speak with him.

[GASP]

No!

Shyu, what's wrong?

The sanctuary doors... They're closed.

Can't you just open them
with firebending,

like you opened that other door?

SHYU: No. Only a fully realized Avatar

is powerful enough
to open this door alone.

Otherwise, the sages must
open the doors together

with five simultaneous fire blasts.

Five fire blasts, huh?

[DING]

I think I can help you out.

ZUKO: Uncle, keep heading north.

Zhao will follow the smoke trail

while I use it as a cover.

Hmmm.

SOKKA: This is a little trick

I picked up from my father.

I seal the lamp oil inside
an animal skin casing.

Shyu lights the oil-soaked twine,

and ta da!

Fake firebending.

You're really outdone yourself
this time, Sokka.

This might actually work.

The sages will hear the explosion,

so as soon as they go off,
you rush in.

It's almost sunset. Are you ready?

Definitely.

Ooh!

Uh! Uh!

They're still locked!

It didn't work.

Why won't it open?! Uh!

Aang, stop.

There's nothing else we can do.

I'm sorry I put you
through all this for nothing.

SOKKA: I don't get it.

That blast looked as strong

as any firebending I've seen.

Sokka, you're a genius!

Wait. How is Sokka a genius?

His plan didn't even work.

Come on, Aang. Let her dream.

You're right.
Sokka's plan didn't work,

but it looks like it did.

Did the definition of genius change

in the last 100 years?

SHYU: Come quickly!
The Avatar has entered the sanctuary!

How did he get in?

I know, but look at the scorch marks,

and down there.

He's inside.
Open the doors immediately

before he contacts Avatar Roku.

-Huh!
-Huh!

[SNEEZE]

It's the Avatar's lemur.

He must have crawled
through the pipes.

We've been tricked!

-[YOWLING]
-Aah!

Now, Aang.

Aang, now's your chance!

The Avatar's coming with me.

Uh! Uh!

Uh!

Close the doors, quickly!

-Uh!
-Aah!

Go!

He made it!

The light hits the statue,
and I talk to Roku.

So why isn't anything happening?

-Huh!
-Huh!

Why isn't it working?
It's sealed shut.

It must have been the light.

Avatar Roku doesn't want us inside.

AANG: Why isn't anything happening?

I don't know what I'm doing.

All I know is airbending.

Please, Avatar Roku, talk to me.

It's good to see you, Aang.

What took you so long?

ZUKO: Why did you help the Avatar?

Because it was once the sage's duty.

It is still our duty.

[ONE PERSON CLAPPING]

What a moving
and heartfelt performance.

I'm certain the Fire Lord
will understand

when you explain why you betrayed him.

Commander Zhao...

ZHAO: And, Prince Zuko,

it was a noble effort,

but your little smokescreen
didn't work.

Two traitors in one day.

The Fire Lord will be pleased.

You're too late, Zhao.

The Avatar's inside,

and the doors are sealed.

No matter. Sooner or later,

he has to come out.

I have something very important
to tell you, Aang.

That is why,
when you were in the spirit world,

I sent my dragon to find you.

Is it about that vision...

The one of the comet?

Yes.

What does it mean?

100 years ago,

Fire Lord Sozin used that comet

to begin the war.

He and his firebending army

harnessed its incredible power

and dealt a deadly first strike

against the other nations.

So the comet made them stronger?

Yes, stronger than you
could even imagine.

But that happened a hundred years ago.

What does the comet
have to do with the war now?

Listen carefully.

Sozin's Comet will return
by the end of this summer,

and Fire Lord Ozai will use its power

to finish the war once and for all.

Aah!

If he succeeds, even the Avatar

won't be able to restore
balance to the world.

Aang, you must defeat the Fire Lord

before the comet arrives.

But I haven't even started
learning waterbending,

not to mention earth and fire.

Mastering the elements takes years
of discipline and practice,

But if the world is to survive,

you must do it by summer's end.

ZHAO: When those doors open,

unleash all your firepower.

How's Aang gonna make it out of this?

How are we gonna make it out of this?

What if I can't master
all the elements in time?

What if I fail?

I know you can do it, Aang,

for you have done it before.

The solstice is ending.

We must go our separate ways for now.

But I won't be able
to come back to the temple.

What if I have questions?

How will I talk to you?

I am a part of you.

When you need to talk to me again,

you will find a way.

A great danger awaits you
at the temple.

I can help you face the threat,

But only if you are ready.

I'm ready.

ZHAO: Ready...

No! Aang!

Fire!

Avatar Roku!

-Uh!
-Uh!

Uh!

-Oh!
-Oh!

Avatar Roku is going to
destroy the temple.

We have to get out of here!

Not without Aang!

Huh!

We got your back.

Thanks. Where's Shyu?

I don't know.

Uh! Uh! Uh!

[GASPS]

No prince, no Avatar.

Apparently the only thing I do have

is five traitors.

But, Commander,
only Shyu helped the Avatar.

Save your stories for the Fire Lord.

As far as I'm concerned,

you are all guilty.

Take them to the prison hold!

[PANTING]

SOKKA: Would you sit down?!

If we hit a bump,
you'll go flying off!

What's bugging you anyway?

It's what Avatar Roku said.

I'm supposed to master
all four elements

before that comet arrives.

Well, let's see.


 


You pretty much mastered airbending,

and that only took you 112 years.

I'm sure you can master

three more elements by next summer.

I haven't even started waterbending,

and we're still weeks away
from the North Pole.

What am I gonna do?!

Calm down.

It's gonna be OK.

If you want,

I can try and teach you

some of the stuff I know.

You'd do that?

We'll need to find

a good source of water first.

Maybe we can find a puddle
for you to splash in.

Nice puddle.

[SNORTING]

[SCREECHES]

AANG: Yeah!

Don't start without me, boy!

Remember the reason we're here.

Oh, right.

Time to practice waterbending.

Great. So, what am I supposed to do?

You could clean the gunk

out of Appa's toes.

So, while you guys
are playing in the water,

I'm supposed to be hard at work

picking mud
out of a giant bison's feet?

Mud and bugs.

OK.

[GRUNTING]

Whoa! Whoa!

Oof!

Someone's changing our course.

What's the meaning of this mutiny?

No one told you to change course.

Actually, someone did.

I assure you,

it is a matter of utmost importance,

Prince Zuko.

Is it something to do with the Avatar?

Even more urgent.

It seems I...

I've lost my lotus tile.

Lotus tile?

For my pai sho game.

Most people think the lotus tile

insignificant.

But it is essential
for the unusual strategy

that I employ.

You've changed our course
for a stupid lotus tile?

See, you, like most people,

underestimate its value.

Just give me 10 minutes
to check the merchants

at this port of call.

Hopefully, they'll have
the lotus tile in stock

and I can get on with my life.

[BREATHING DEEPLY]

I'm lucky to have such
an understanding nephew.

[SIGHS]

Yeah, don't get too happy.

You've got to do me next.

[SIGHS]

This is a pretty basic move,

but it still took me
months to perfect.

So, don't be frustrated

if you don't get it right away.

Just push and pull the water
like this.

The key is getting
the wrist movement right.

Like this?

That's almost right.

If you keep practicing,

I'm sure eventually...

Hey, I'm bending it already!

Wow! I can't believe
you got that so quickly.

It took me two months
to learn that move.

Well, you had to figure it out

all on your own.

I'm lucky enough
to have a great teacher.

Thanks.

So, what's next?

This is a more difficult move.

I call it streaming the water.

It's harder than it looks,

so don't be disappointed if...

Nice work.

Though the over-the-head
flair was unnecessary.

Sorry.

Well, don't stop now.

Keep 'em coming.

Well, I kind of know
this one other move,

But it's pretty hard.

I haven't even totally
figured it out yet.

The idea is to create
a big, powerful wave.

[GRUNTS]

So, like this?

Aang!

Looks like I got
the hang of that move.

What else you got?

That's enough practicing for today.

Yeah, I'll say!

You just practiced our supplies

Down the river.

Uh, sorry.

I'm sure we can find some way

to replace all this stuff.

My life was hard enough

when you were just an airbender.

[PEOPLE CHATTERING]

MAN: Please, put me down!

VENDOR: See the wonder in this bag!

Who's brave enough
to look into this bag?!

Wow!

We've got exactly
three copper pieces left

from the money that King Bumi gave us.

Let's spend it wisely.

Uh, make that
two copper pieces, Sokka.

I couldn't say no to this whistle.

[AIR HISSES]

It doesn't even work.

[SQUEALS]

See? Even Momo thinks
it's a piece of junk.

No offense, Aang,

but I'll hold the money from now on.

MAN: Earth Nation! Fire Nation!

Water Nation.

So long as bargains
are your inclination,

you're welcome here!

Don't be shy.

Come on by!

Oh, you there!

I can see from your clothing

that you're world traveling types.

Perhaps I can interest you

in some exotic curios?

Sure!

What are curios?

I'm not entirely sure,

But we got 'em.

[GASPS]

Huh?

MAN: I've never seen
such a fine specimen of lemur.

That beast would fetch me a hefty sum

if you'd be interested in bartering.

[SQUAWKS]

[HISSES]

Momo's not for sale.

Look at this, Aang!

It's a waterbending scroll.

Check out these crazy moves.

Where did you get
a waterbending scroll?

Let's just say I got it up north

at a most reasonable price...

Free.

Wait a minute.

Sea-loving traders

with suspiciously acquired merchandise

and pet reptile birds?

You guys are pirates!

We prefer to think of ourselves as

high-risk traders.

So, how much for the traded scroll?

I've already got a buyer...

A nobleman in the Earth Kingdom...

Unless, of course, you kids have

200 gold pieces on you right now.

I know how to deal
with these guys, Katara.

Pirates love to haggle.

Watch and learn.

What say ye to the price of...

One copper piece?

Ha ha ha ha!

The price is 200 gold pieces.

I don't haggle on items this rare.

OK, two copper pieces.

It's not as amusing
the second time, boy.

Aang, can we get out of here?

I feel like we're getting weird looks.

Aye! We be casting off now!

What was that all about, Katara?

Yeah, I was just starting
to browse through

their boomerang collection.

I'll just feel a lot better

once we get away from here.

Hey, you!

Get back here!

Well, well.

Look who's come to their senses.

Told you the haggling would pay off.

[GROWLING]

There they are!

Get 'em!

Nobody's going nowhere!

[LAUGHING]

I don't think these pirates

are here to trade with us.

Get back here!

You little...

Come on!

This way.

Let's cut 'em off!

Whoa!

Whoa!

Oof!

Oh! Oh!

Oh! Oh!

[SCREAMING]

My cabbages!

This place is worse than Omashu!

[GROANING]

Aha!

[SHUDDERS]

I hope that lemur of yours

has nine lives.

Now, who gets to taste

the steel of my blade first?

No, thanks.

Haa!

[SCREAMS]

Grab on tight!

Aang, I thought we were

running away from the pirates.

Just hang on.

BOTH: Whoa!

Ow!

Whoa!

I used to kind of look up to pirates,

but those guys are terrible.

I know.

That's why I took this.

No way!

Isn't it great?!

No wonder they were
trying to hack us up.

You stole their waterbending scroll.

I prefer to think of it as

high-risk trading.

Ha ha ha.

Good one, Katara.

Sokka, where to you think they got it?

They stole it from a waterbender.

It doesn't matter.

You put all of our lives in danger

just so you could learn

some stupid, fancy splashes.

These are real waterbending forms.

You know how crucial it is

for Aang to learn waterbending.

[SIGHS]

Whatever.

Well, what's done is done.

We have it.

We might as well learn from it.

I've checked all the shops
on this pier.

Not a lotus tile
in the entire marketplace.

It's good to know this trip

was a complete waste of time

for everyone!

Quite the contrary.

I always say
the only thing better than

finding something you are looking for

is finding something
you weren't looking for

at a great bargain.

You bought a sungi horn?

For music night on the ship.

Now, if we only had some woodwinds.

Oh, this place looks promising.

Oh, that is handsome!

Wouldn't it look
magnificent in the galley?

We lost the water tribe girl

and the little bald monk

she was traveling with.

This monk, did he have
an arrow on his head?

[IMITATES MONKEY]

I just want to try
this one move first,

and then it's all yours.

Here, hold it open for me.

The single water whip.

Looks doable.

Ow!

Ha ha ha!

What's so funny?

I'm sorry, but you deserved that.

You've been duped.

She's only interested
in teaching herself.

Aang will get his turn

once I figure out the water whip.

[SCREECHES]

Ugh! Why can't I get
this stupid move?!

You'll get it.

You've just gotta shift your weight

through the stances.

There. See?

The key to bending is...

Will you please shut your air hole!

Believe it or not,
your infinite wisdom

gets a little old sometimes!

Why don't we just
throw the scroll away

since you're so naturally gifted?!

What?!

Oh, my gosh, Aang.

I am so sorry.

I don't know what came over me.

But you know what?

It won't happen again.

Here, this is yours.

I don't want to have

anything to do with it anymore.

It's OK, Katara.

What about Momo?

He's the real victim here.

I'm sorry, Momo.

And what about me?

There was that time you...

No more apologies.

Shouldn't we stop to search the woods?

We don't need to stop.

They stole
a waterbending scroll, right?

Mm-hmm.

Then they'll be on the water.

[PURRS]

Shh.

Momo, go back to sleep.

[COOS]

Shh!

[GRUNTING]

Shoot!

Come on, water! Work with me here!

OK, what if I... Ow!

[DISTANT YELLING]

OK, Katara,

shift your weight through the stances.

Ugh!

[SCRAPING]

[GASPS]

Ah! No!

Let go of me!

[GRUNTS]

I'll save you from the pirates.

Tell me where he is,

and I won't hurt you or your brother.

Go jump in the river!

Try to understand,

I need to capture him

to restore something I've lost...

My honor.

Perhaps in exchange,

I can restore something you've lost.

My mother's necklace.

How did you get that?!

I didn't steal it

if that's what you're wondering.

Tell me where he is.

No!

Enough of this necklace garbage.

You promised the scroll.

I wonder how much money this is worth.

[GASPS] No!

A lot, apparently.

Now, you help me find what I want,

you'll get this back,

and everyone goes home happy.

Search the woods for the boy
and meet back here.

Fine.

[GROANING]

Huh?

Where did she go?

I don't believe it.

[YAWNS]

What's wrong?

She took the scroll.

She's obsessed with that thing.

It's just a matter of time

before she gets us all in deep...

Whoa!

[SCREAMS]

[YELLS]

[GRUNTS]

I've got him. Come on!

Oh, what?
I'm not good enough to kidnap?

Aagh!

Nice work.

[STRAINING]

Aang, this is all my fault.

No, Katara, it isn't.

Yeah, it kind of is.

Give me the boy.

You give us the scroll.

You're really gonna
hand over the Avatar

for a stupid piece of parchment?

Don't listen to him.

He's trying to turn
us against each other.

Your friend is the Avatar?

Sure is.

And I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more

on the black market
than that fancy scroll.

Shut your mouth,

you water tribe peasant!

Yeah, Sokka,
you really should shut your mouth.

I'm just saying,

it's bad business sense.

Just imagine how much the Fire Lord

would pay for the Avatar.

You guys would be set for life.

Keep the scroll.

We can buy 100 with the reward

we'll get for the kid.

You'll regret breaking a deal with me.

[GROWLS]

[SCREAMING]

[YELLING]

Thanks, Momo.

I owe you a bushel of apples.

[COUGHING]

[GRUNTS]

Hey!

[SQUAWKS]

[SQUAWK]

[SWORDS CLANGING]

Aah!

Aang, are you there?

I'm over here! Follow my voice.

Where? I can't find you!

I'm right here!

Uh, never mind.

I'll find you!

Run!

Katara, you're OK.

Help me get this boat
back in the water

so we can get out of here.

[ALL STRAINING]

We need a team of rhinos

to budge this ship.

A team of rhinos...

Or two waterbenders.

KATARA: Everybody in!

Are you so busy fighting

you cannot see your own ship

has set sail?

We have no time
for your proverbs, uncle.

It's no proverb.

Bleeding hog monkeys!

Ha ha ha ha!

[LAUGHING]

Hey, that's my boat!

Maybe it should be a proverb.

Come on, uncle.

Sokka, can't you make it
go any faster?

I don't know how.

This thing wasn't made
by the water tribe.

[GRUNTING]

Whoa!

Whoa!

Oof!

Hey! You did the water whip.

I couldn't have done it
without your help.

Will you two quit
congratulating each other

and help me out?

[SQUEAKING]

[SCREAMING]

That's good.

Wah!

Hah!

[SCREAMING]

Aang, look!

Oh, no!

[AIR HISSING]

Aah! Oh!

Have you lost your mind?

This is no time for flute practice!

We can stop the boat.

Aang, together,

push and pull the water.

It's working.

It's slowing down.

We're doing it!

But we have another problem.

Whoa! Whoa!

Jump!

[SCREAMING]

AANG: I knew a bison whistle
would come in handy.

Thanks, Appa.

SOKKA: Yeah, we owe you one.

[GRUNTS]

My boat!

[PANTING]

[CHUCKLES]

Prince Zuko,

you're really going to
get a kick out of this.

That lotus tile
was in my sleeve the whole time!

[GROWLING]

[GRUNTS]

KATARA: Aang,

I still owe you an apology.

You were just so good at waterbending

without really trying.

I got so competitive

that I put us all in danger.

I'm sorry.

That's OK, Katara.

Besides, who needs
that stupid scroll anyway?

Is that really how you feel?

The scroll!

First, what did you learn?

Stealing is wrong.

Unless it's from pirates.

AANG: Ha ha ha!

Good one, Katara.

[SCREECHING]

[ANIMALS GRUNTING]

Where's Momo?

[SCREECH]

Hang on, Momo!

Uhh!


 


[ANIMALS GRUNTING]

All right, you too.

This is going to take forever.

That works.

[GRUNTING]

These are Fire Nation traps.

You can tell from the metalwork.

We'd better pack up camp
and get moving.

Uh-uh! No flying this time.

What? Why wouldn't we fly?

Think about it.

Somehow Prince Zuko
and the Fire Nation keep finding us.

It's because they spot Appa,
he's just too noticeable.

What? Appa's not too noticeable.

He's a gigantic fluffy monster
with an arrow on his head!

It's kind of hard to miss him.

[GROWLS]

Sokka's just jealous
because he doesn't have an arrow.

I know you all want to fly,

but my instincts tell me

we should play it safe
this time and walk.

Who made you the boss?

I'm not the boss, I'm the leader.

You're the leader?

But your voice still cracks.

I'm the oldest, and I'm a warrior!

So I'm the leader.

If anyone's the leader, it's Aang.

I mean, he is the Avatar.

Are you kidding?
He's just a goofy kid.

He's right.

Why do boys always think
someone has to be the leader?

I bet you wouldn't be so bossy
if you kissed a girl.

I've kissed a girl!

You just haven't met her.

Who? Gran-Gran?

I've met Gran-Gran.

No, besides Gran-Gran.

Look, my instincts tell me

we have a better chance
of slipping through on foot,

and a leader has to
trust his instincts.

OK, we'll try it your way,
O wise leader.

Who knows? Walking might be fun.

Walking stinks!

How did people go anywhere
without a flying bison?

I don't know, Aang.

Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts?

They seem to know everything.

SOKKA: Ha ha, very funny.

I'm tired of carrying this pack.

You know who you should
ask to carry it for a while?

Sokka's instincts!

That's a great idea.

Hey, Sokka's instincts,
would you mind...

OK, OK, I get it!

Look, guys, I'm tired, too.

But the important thing is that
we're safe from the Fire Nation.

Run!

Huh!

We're cut off!

Sokka, your shirt!

Aah!

If you let us pass,
we promise not to hurt you.

What are you doing?

Bluffing.

You, promise not to hurt us?

Unh.

Uhh...

Nice work, Sokka. How did you do that?

Uh... Instinct?

Look!

Uhh!

Unh!

Down you go.

Uhh!

They're in the trees!

Ha ha ha!

Hah!

Unh!

Hey, he was mine.

Gotta be quicker next time.

Unh!

Uhh.

Man!

Hey.

Hi.

You just took out a whole army
almost single-handed.

Army?!

There were only, like, 20 guys.

My name is Jet,

and these are my freedom fighters.

Sneers, Longshot, Smellerbee,

The Duke, and Pipsqueak.

Pipsqueak, that's a funny name.

[SNIFFS]

You think my name is funny?

It's hilarious!

[LAUGHING]

Unh!

Um, thanks for saving us, Jet.

We're lucky you were there.

I should be thanking you.

We were waiting to ambush
those soldiers all morning.

We just needed the right distraction.

And then you guys stumbled in.

We were relying on instincts.

JET: You'll get yourself
killed doing that.

[SNIFFING]

Hey, Jet, these barrels are filled
with blasting jelly.

That's a great score.

And these boxes are filled
with jellied candy.

Also good.

Let's not get those mixed up.

We'll take the stuff
back to the hideout.

You guys have a hideout?

You want to see it?

Yes, we want to see it!

JET: We're here.

Where? There's nothing here.

Hold this.

Why? What's this do?

Aah!

Aang?

I'll get up on my own.

Grab hold of me, Katara.

Nice place you got!

It's beautiful up here.

It's beautiful, and more importantly,

the Fire Nation can't find us.

They would love to find you,

wouldn't they, Jet?

It's not going to happen, Smellerbee.

KATARA: Why does the Fire Nation
want to find you?

JET: I guess you could say

I've been causing them
a little trouble.

See, they took over a nearby
Earth Kingdom town

a few years back.

We've been ambushing their troops,

cutting off their supply lines,

and doing anything we can
to mess with them.

One day, we'll drive the Fire Nation

out of here for good,

And free that town.

That's so brave.

Yeah, nothing's braver
than a guy in a tree house.

Don't pay any attention to my brother.

No problem. He probably
had a rough day.

So, you all live here?

That's right.

Longshot over there,

His town got burned down
by the Fire Nation.

And we found The Duke
trying to steal our food.

I don't think he ever
really had a home.

What about you?

The Fire Nation killed my parents.

I was only eight years old.

That day changed me forever.

Sokka and I lost our mother
to the Fire Nation.

I'm so sorry, Katara.

[BIRDS CAWING]

[APPA GROWLING]

JET: Today, we struck another blow

against the Fire Nation swine.

[CHEERING]

I got a special joy
from the look on one soldier's face,

when The Duke dropped down
on his helmet

and rode him like a wild hog-monkey!

[CHEERING]

Now, the Fire Nation
thinks they don't have to worry

about a couple of kids
hiding in the trees.

Maybe they're right.

[BOOING]

Or maybe, they're dead wrong.

[CHEERING]

Hey, Jet, nice speech.

Thanks.

By the way,

I was really impressed
with you and Aang.

That was some great bending
I saw out there today.

Well, he's great. He's the Avatar.

I could use some more training.

Avatar, huh? Very nice.

Thanks, Jet.

So I might know a way

that you and Aang
can help in our struggle.

Unfortunately,
we have to leave tonight.

Sokka, you're kidding me.

I needed you on an important
mission tomorrow.

What mission?

[BIRD CALL]

[ANSWERING BIRD CALL]

What are you doing?

Shh. It amplifies vibrations.

Good trick.

Nothing yet.

Wait, yes!

Someone's approaching.

How many?

I think there's just one.

[BIRD CALL]

Good work, Sokka. Ready your weapon.

Wait! False alarm.

He's just an old man.

What are you doing
in our woods, you leech?

Please, sir, I'm just a traveler.

Uhh!

Ohh! Unh!

Uhh!

Do you like destroying towns?

Do you like destroying families?

Do you?!

Oh, please, let me go. Have mercy.

Does the Fire Nation let people go?

Does the Fire Nation have mercy?

Uhh!

Jet, he's just an old man!

He's Fire Nation! Search him!

But he's not hurting anyone.

Have you forgotten that
the Fire Nation killed your mother?

Remember why you fight!

We got his stuff, Jet.

This doesn't feel right.

It's what has to be done.
Now let's get out of here.

Come on, Sokka!

[LAUGHING]

Sokka, look what The Duke gave me.

[HISSES]

Ow, quit it!

Hey, Sokka. Is Jet back?

Yeah, he's back. But we're leaving.

What?

But I made him this hat.

Your boyfriend Jet's a thug.

What?!

No, he's not.

He's messed up, Katara.

AANG: He's not messed up.

He's just got a different way of life.

A really fun way of life.

He beat and robbed

a harmless old man.

I want to hear
Jet's side of the story.

Sokka, you told them what happened,

but you didn't mention
that the guy was Fire Nation?

No, he conveniently
left that part out.

Fine, but even if he was Fire Nation,

he was a harmless civilian.

He was an assassin, Sokka.

See? There's a compartment
for poison in the knife.

He was sent to eliminate me.

You helped save my life, Sokka.

I knew there was an explanation.

I didn't see any knife.

That's because he was concealing it.

See, Sokka?

I'm sure you just
didn't notice the knife.

There was no knife!

I'm going back to the hut

and packing my things.

Tell me you guys aren't leaving yet.

I really need your help.

What can we do?

The Fire Nation is planning
on burning down our forest.

If you both use waterbending
to fill the reservoir,

we could fight the fires.

But if you leave now,

they'll destroy the whole valley.

We can't leave now

with the Fire Nation
about to burn down a forest!

I'm sorry, Katara.

Jet's very smooth,
but we can't trust him.

You know what I think?

You're jealous that he's a better
warrior and a better leader.

Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet.

It's just that my instincts...

Well, my instincts tell me

we need to stay here a little longer
and help Jet.

Come on, Aang.

Sorry, Sokka.

[SNORING]

JET: Let's go.

Huh?

Now listen.

You're not to blow the dam
until I give the signal.

If the reservoir isn't full,

the Fire Nation troops could survive.

But what about the people in the town?

Won't they get wiped out, too?

Look, Duke, that's the price

of ridding this area
of the Fire Nation.

Now don't blow the dam
until I give the signal.

Got it?

[RUSTLING]

Ow!

Where do you think
you're going, ponytail?

JET: Sokka.

I'm glad you decided to join us.

I heard your plan
to destroy the Earth Kingdom town.

Our plan is to rid the valley
of the Fire Nation.

There are people living there, Jet,

mothers and fathers and children.

We can't win without
making some sacrifices.

You lied to Aang and Katara
about the forest fire.

Because they don't understand
the demands of war.

Not like you and I do.

I do understand.

I understand that
there's nothing you won't do

to get what you want.

I was hoping you'd have an open mind.

But I can see you've made your choice.

I can't let you warn Katara and Aang.

Take him for a walk.

A long walk.

You can't do this!

Cheer up, Sokka.

We're going to win a great victory

against the Fire Nation today.

KATARA: Jet, I'm sorry about how
Sokka's been acting.

No worries. He already apologized.

Really? Sokka apologized?

Yeah, I was surprised, too.

I got the sense that maybe you

Talked to him or something.

Yeah, I did.

I guess something you said
got through to him.

Anyhow, he went out
on a scouting mission

with Pipsqueak and Smellerbee.

I'm glad he cooled off.

He's so stubborn sometimes.

Uhh!

All right, we're here.

Underground water's trying
to escape from these vents.

I need you guys to help it along.

I've never used bending
on water I can't see.

I don't know...

Katara, you can do this.

What about me?

I know the Avatar can do this.

JET: Yes! Good job.

This river empties into the reservoir.

A few more geysers
and it will be full.

Look, there's another steam vent.

OK, you two keep it up,

I'll go check on things
at the reservoir.

KATARA: When we're done,
we'll meet you over there.

Actually, probably better
if you meet me

back at the hideout when you're done.

I bet that's enough.

And I'm not just
saying that to be lazy.

Let's catch up with Jet
at the reservoir.

I thought we agreed
to meet Jet back at the hideout.

Well, we finished early.

I'm sure he'll be happy to see us.

Come on, move along!

How can you stand by and do nothing

while Jet wipes out a whole town?

Hey, listen, Sokka,
Jet's a great leader.

We follow what he says,
and things always turn out OK.

If that's how Jet leads,

Then he's got a lot to learn!

Hey!

Unh!

While you two are up there,

you might want to practice
your knot work.

Hey, Smellerbee.

You going to eat your lychee nuts?

Ooh.

What are they doing?

Hey, those are the red barrels

he got from the Fire Nation.

Why would they need blasting jelly?

Because Jet's going to
blow up the dam.

What?

No, that would destroy the town.

Jet wouldn't do that.

I've got to stop him!

Jet wouldn't do that.

Unh!

Yes, I would.

Jet, why?

Katara, you would, too,
if you just stop to think.

Think about what the Fire Nation
did to your mother.

We can't let them do that
to anyone else ever again.

This isn't the answer.

I want you to understand me, Katara.

I thought your brother
would understand, but...

Where's Sokka?

Katara.

Unh!

I need to get to the dam.

You're not going anywhere
without your glider.

Unh! Uhh! Unh!

I'm not going to fight you, Jet.

You'll have to
if you want your glider back.

Hah!

Unh!

Hah!

Aah!

Unh!

Aah!

Unh!

Aah!

Unh!

Ohh...

Unh!

Why, Jet?

I can't believe I trusted you.

You lied to me!

You're sick, and I trusted you!

[BIRD CALL]

[BIRD CALL]

What are you doing?

You're too late.

No!

Unh!

Sokka's still out there.

He's our only chance.

Come on, Sokka.

I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

Please...

No.

Sokka didn't make it in time.

All those people.

Jet, you monster!

This was a victory, Katara.

Remember that.

The Fire Nation is gone,

and this valley will be safe.

SOKKA: It will be safe,

without you.

Sokka!

I warned the villagers of your plan,

Just in time.

-What?!
-At first, they didn't believe me.

The Fire Nation soldiers
assumed I was a spy.

But one man vouched for me,

the old man you attacked.

He urged them to trust me,
and we got everyone out in time.

Mrs. Pretty!

Sokka, you fool!

We could have freed this valley!

Who would be free?

Everyone would be dead.

You traitor!

No, Jet. You became the traitor

when you stopped
protecting innocent people.

Katara, please, help me.

Good-bye, Jet.

Yip, yip.

[APPA RUMBLING]

AANG: We thought
you were going to the dam.

How come you went to the town instead?

Let me guess.

Your instincts told you.

Hey, sometimes they're right.

Um, Sokka?

You know we're going
the wrong way right?

And sometimes they're wrong.

[APPA RUMBLING]

Um, aren't you forgetting the tarp?

Right. Got it.

Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp

on top of the tent.

You know, so we don't get rained on?

Ordinarily, you'd be right,

but seeing how it's the dry season,

you're not.


 


Besides, that tarp makes
a pretty warm blanket.

But what if it does rain?

What if it doesn't?

Then I would have put
the tarp up for nothing.

Uh! You're infuriating.

Katara, why don't you worry about
gathering the firewood?

Because that kindling's
looking pretty sorry.

If you don't like my firewood...

Uh!

Fine by me! If you're not
gonna do your job...

Uh!

Okay, I got the grub
if you guys got the...

Hey, where's the campfire,

and what happened to the tent?

Why don't you ask
Miss Know-it-all, Queen of the twigs?

Oh, yeah? Well,
you're Mr. Lazy-bum, King of the...

Tents!

[CHUCKLES]

Okay. Listen, guys.

Harsh words won't solve problems.

Action will.

Why don't you just switch jobs?

-Sounds good.
-Whatever.

You see that?

Settling feuds and making peace...

All in a day's work for the Avatar.

[YOWLING]

Come on, Momo. That's fair.

Appa's got five stomachs.

[CHATTERING]

There it is, guys, The Great Divide.

Wow. I could just stare at it forever.

Okay. I've seen enough.

How can you not be fascinated, Sokka?

This is the largest canyon
in the entire world.

Then I'm sure we'll be
able to see it very clearly

from the air while we fly away.

Hey, if you're looking
for the canyon guide,

I was here first.

Ooh. Canyon guide. Sounds informative.

Believe me, he's more
than a tour guide.

He's an earthbender,

and the only way
in and out of the canyon

is with his help.

And he's taking my tribe across next.

Calm down. We know you're next.

You wouldn't be calm if the
Fire Nation destroyed your home

and forced you to flee.

My whole tribe has to
walk thousands of miles

to the capital city of Ba Sing Se.

You're a refugee.

Huh. Tell me something I don't know.

Is that your tribe?

It most certainly is not.

That's the Zhang tribe,

a bunch of lowlife thieves.

They've been the enemies

of my tribe for a hundred years.

[WHISTLES]

Hey, Zhangs!

I'm saving a spot for my tribe,

so don't even think of stealing it.

Where are the rest of the Gan Jin?

Still tidying up their campsite?

Yes, but they sent me
ahead of them to hold a spot.

I didn't know the canyon guide
took reservations.

Huh! Of course you didn't.

That's the ignorance I'd expect

from a messy Zhang,

so unorganized
and ill-prepared for a journey.

[MEN SHOUTING]

[CHATTERING]

Uhh!

Sorry about the wait, youngsters.

Who's ready to cross this here canyon?

Uh, one of them, I think.

I was here first.
My party's on their way.

I can't guide people who aren't here.

Guess you guys will have
to make the trip tomorrow.

Wait! Here they come.

You're not seriously gonna cave in

to these spoiled Gan Jins.

I mean, we're refugees, too,

and we've got sick people
that need shelter.

I, uh, well...

We've got old people
who are weary from traveling.

Sick people get
priority over old people.

Maybe you Zhangs wouldn't
have so many sick people

if you weren't such slobs.

If you Gan Jins weren't so clean,

maybe you wouldn't live to be so old.

GAN JIN: I could smell your stink...

Well, Aang, ready to put

your peacemaking skills to the test?

I don't know...

A fight over chores is one thing.

These people have been
feuding for a hundred years.

Everyone listen up!

This is the Avatar,

and if you give him a chance,

I'm sure he can come up
with a compromise

that will make everyone happy.

Uh, you could share the earthbender
and travel together?

Absolutely not. We'd rather
be taken by the Fire Nation

than travel with those
stinking thieves.

We wouldn't travel
with you pompous fools anyway.

[ALL ARGUING]

All right, here's the deal!

You're all going down together,

and Appa here
will fly your sick and elderly across.

Does that seem fair?

Sorry, Appa. You'll have to
do this on your own.

Aang, this feuding tribe
stuff is serious business.

Are you sure it's a good idea
getting involved in this?

To tell the truth, I'm not sure,

but when have I ever been?

He's the avatar, Sokka.

Making peace
between people is his job.

His job's gonna make us cross this
whole thing on foot, isn't it?

Okay, now comes the bad news.

No food allowed in the canyon.

It attracts dangerous predators.

-No food? This is ridiculous.
-[ALL CLAMORING]

Oh, you babies can go
a day without food.

Would you rather be hungry or dead?

Now, we're heading down in 10 minutes.

All food better be in your gut,

or in the garbage!

Appa's gonna take good care of you
till we get there.

See you on the other side, buddy.

Yip yip!

[GRUNTS]

Huh!

AANG: Nice bending.

The job's much more than bending, kid.

Folks want information.

Many of you are probably wondering

how canyons are formed.

Experts tell us
this canyon was most likely

carved into the ground
by earth spirits,

who were angry at local farmers

for not offering them
a proper sacrifice.

[BOTH GASP]

[RUMBLING]

[SCREAMING]

Uh! Ha ha!
Guess the spirits are still angry.

Hope you all brought sacrifices.

GUIDE: Okay. Everyone
stand clear of the wall.

Uh! Uh!

Why did you do that?

These people are fleeing
the Fire Nation, aren't they?

I've got to make sure
we can't be followed.

We'll be safe now.

Uh!

Ah!

We've got to help him! Uh!

Aah!

[COUGHS]

Okay, now we've got to help me!

Aah!

Hah!

What was that?

Canyon crawler.

Oh... And there's sure to be more.

Your arms... They're broken.

Without my arms, I got no bending.

In other words...

We're trapped in this canyon.

I thought the whole point
of ditching our food

was so we wouldn't have to deal
with things like canyon crawlers.

It's the Zhangs.

They took food down here
even after the guide told them not to.

What?

If there's anyone who
can't go without food for a day,

it's these pampered Gan Jins.

GAN JIN: I hope you're happy.

We're stuck in this canyon
with no way out.

Why don't you thank yourself,
food-hider?

Look, sticking together
is the only way to...

I'm not walking another step
with the likes of them.

Now there's something we can agree on.

Any ideas?

No bending. We need to get
out of this canyon.

I won't die down here.

I won't become part of the food chain.

See? We're going to become
part of the food chain

because of you.

Sure. Unjustly blame
the Zhangs, like you always do.

Gladly.

AANG: Enough!

I thought I could
help you guys get along,

but I guess that's not gonna happen.

We should split up...

Gan Jins on this side
and Zhangs on that side.

We'll travel in two separate lines.

Sokka, you go with the Zhangs,

and, Katara, you go with the Gan Jins.

See if you can find out why
they hate each other so much.

So, you guys aren't gonna
put up your tarps?

What for? It's the dry season.

Exactly!

Besides, we like to use
the tarp as a blanket.

Finally someone gets it.

Do you really think it'll rain?

No, but you can never
be too careful, right?

[GASPS]

Would you care for some bread, Katara?

So it was you guys who had food.

Oh, come now.

Do you really think
that tribe of thieves

isn't smuggling food?

Why should my people go hungry

when the sneaky Zhangs
are stuffing their faces?

Well, I guess it's okay
if everyone's doing it.

So, why does your tribe
hate the Zhangs so much?

You seem like a smart girl, Katara.

I bet you would enjoy
hearing some history.

GAN JIN: The patriarch
of our tribe, Jin Wei,

was an earthbender warrior

who was assigned an important duty:

Transporting our sacred orb

From the great eastern gate
to the great western gate.

Taking the orb
from the east to the west

represents the sun's
rising and setting.

It was our tribe's
ancient redemption ritual.

But as he approached the gate,

Jin Wei was attacked
by one of the Zhangs...

A vermin named Wei Jin

who looked at the orb with envy.

That coward Wei Jin
knocked Jin Wei to the ground

and stole our sacred orb.

Our people have never forgotten.

You can never trust a Zhang.

Care for some meat?

Would I?

I know what you must be thinking.

We're horrible for
endangering everybody

by bringing food down here.

Mmm-hmm.

The Gan Jins think so badly of us,

they probably assumed
we brought food in

and decided to bring
food in themselves.

That's why we brought food in.

Mmm.

Our conflict with the Gan Jin

goes back over 100 years.

ZHANG: Our forefather, Wei Jin,
was leaving the western gate

of our village when he saw
a figure in the distance.

It was a man of the Gan Jin tribe,
Jin Wei,

collapsed on the ground.

Noble Wei Jin stopped to help him.

Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb,

A very powerful relic used in
his tribe's redemption ritual.

Wei Jin tried to tend
to the man's wounds,

but Jin Wei insisted the orb
was more important

and asked him to take it
back to his tribe.

Kind Wei Jin promised to send
help for the man

as soon as he could.

But as Wei Jin crossed the border

to return the orb
into Gan Jin territory,

he was arrested.

[SWORDS CLANG]

Instead of thanking him
for his kind and selfless deed,

they sentenced him
to 20 long years in prison.

We Zhangs will never forget
that injustice.

That's just terrible.

Are you gonna finish that?

[GRUNTING]

Sure would be nice

to be around one of those campfires.

Telling stories and laughing.

It's okay, Momo.
We'll be out of here soon enough,

and then we can eat our weight
in litchi nuts.

[SQUEAKS]

[BUZZING]

[SQUEAKS]

Nah. I'll wait for the litchi nuts.

GUIDE: It's lonely,
isn't it, being impartial?

I wish I could help
these people get along,

but it just seems impossible.

Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem

Is getting out of here.

I'm not so sure the two problems
are unrelated.

All clear.
We're almost to the other side.

AANG: Katara, Sokka,
will these people cooperate

long enough to get out of the canyon?

I don't think so, Aang.

The Zhangs really
wronged the Gan Jins.

They ambushed Jin Wei
and stole the sacred orb.

What are you talking about?

Yeah, Katara, what
are you talking about?

Wei Jin didn't steal the orb.

He was returning it
to their village gate

and was wrongfully
punished by the Gan Jin.

Not punished enough, if you ask me.

Okay, okay. I get it.
Now I need your help.

Let's get everyone together
at the base of the canyon wall.

[CROWD CHEERING]

Please, everyone.
As soon as we get out of here,

we can eat and then
go our separate ways.

But I need you all
to put your heads together

and figure out a way up this cliff.

Maybe the Zhang can climb the wall

With their long,
disgusting fingernails.

ZHANG: Oh, sorry.
I forgot that to the Gan Jin,

unclipped fingernails is a crime
punishable by 20 years in jail.

Why, you dirty thief.

You pompous fool.

[ALL SHOUTING AT ONCE]

Guys, focus!

How many times do I have to say it?

Harsh words won't solve problems.

Action will!

Perhaps the Avatar is right.

Yes. Perhaps he is.

Harsh words will never
solve our problems.

Action will.

-Huh!
-Huh!

Aah!

To the death, and let this
be the end of this rivalry.

You know, I take it back.

Harsh words aren't so bad.

Huh?

[GRUNTS]

Hyah!

[PANTING]

AANG: Is that food?

Everyone smuggled food down here?

Unbelievable!

You guys put our lives in danger

because you couldn't go
without a snack for a day?

You are all awful!

So hungry...

Is that egg custard in that tart?

[SCREECHING]

[SCREAMING]

Oh, no.
That's a lot of canyon crawlers.

We barely survived one.

GUIDE: They're coming back for me.

They've had a taste,
and they're coming back for me.

Sokka, wait.

I don't care about the stupid feud.

I just want us to get
out of here alive.

Me, too. I only took their side
because they fed me.

[SNORTING]

Hyah!

Hyah!

[GASPS]

[SHOUTING]

Aah!

[SCREAMING]

Aah!

[PANTING]

Everybody, watch me and do what I do!

Now follow me.

We're riding out of this hole.

Everyone get off!

We made it!

Uh!

Huh!

I never thought a Gan Jin
could get his hands dirty like that.

And I never knew you Zhangs
were so reliable in a pinch.

Perhaps we're not
so different after all.

[SIGHS]

Too bad we can't rewrite history.

You thieves stole our sacred orb
from Jin Wei.

You tyrants unjustly imprisoned
Wei Jin for 20 long years.

Ugh. Wait a second...

Jin Wei? Wei Jin? I know those guys.

Yes, yes.
We're all aware of the story.

No, I mean I really knew them.

I might not look it,
but I'm 112 years old.

I was there 100 years ago

on the day you're talking about.

There seems to be a lot of confusion
about what happened.

First of all, Jin Wei
and Wei Jin weren't enemies.

They were brothers. Twins, in fact.

And they were eight,
and most importantly,

They were just playing a game.

-Ahh!
-Ahh!

The sacred orb from the legend...

That was the ball.

And the eastern and western gates

Were the goal posts.

Jin Wei had the ball
and was running toward the goal

when he fell and fumbled it.

Wei Jin didn't steal the ball.

He picked it up and started
running it back

toward the other goal,
but he stepped out of bounds.

[BLOWS WHISTLE]

So the official put him
in the penalty box...

Not for 20 long years
but for two short minutes.

Hee hee hee!

There was no stealing
and no putting anyone in prison...

Just a game.

You're saying the sacred orb
was actually a sacred ball?

Nope, just a regular ball.

What about our tribe's
redemption ritual?

That's what the game
was called, Redemption.

As soon as someone got
the ball from one goal to the other,

everyone would yell, "Redemption!"

Don't get me wrong...
Wei Jin was kind of a slob,

and Jin Wei was a little stuffy.

That much is true.

But they respected
each other's differences

enough to share
the same playing field.

I suppose it's time
we forget the past.

And look to the future.

Good to see you, boy.
Did you miss me? [LAUGHS]

I cannot thank you enough, Avatar.

Well, you know. I try.

Oh!

Let us travel
to the Earth Kingdom capital

as one tribe.

[CHEERING]

I'm going, too!

I'm sick of this place.

That's some luck
you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin.

You could call it luck,

or you could call it lying.

-What?
-I made the whole thing up.

You did not.

That is so wrong.

Now, where's that custard tart?

I'm starving!

[CLOSING THEME PLAYING]

KATARA: We need you, Aang.

I need you, too.

[THUNDER RUMBLING]

Be careful, guys!

Guys?

Gyatso?

GYATSO: Why did you disappear?

I didn't mean to.

We need you, Aang.

AANG: [SCREAMS]


 


VOICES: We need you, Aang.
We need you.

We need you, Aang. We need you.

-[GASPS]
-MOMO: [CHATTERING]

Huh! What's going on?

Did we get captured again?

It's nothing. I just had a bad dream.

Go back to sleep.

You don't have to tell me twice.

Are you all right, Aang?

I'm okay.

You seem to be having
a lot of nightmares lately.

You want to tell me about it?

I think I just need some rest.

You guys want to hear about my dream?

That's okay. I didn't want
to talk about it anyway.

[GRUMBLING]

Look at those clear skies, buddy.

Should be some smooth flying.

Well, we'd better
smoothly fly ourselves to a market,

because we're out of food.

Guys, wait. This was in my dream.

We shouldn't go to the market.

What happened in your dream?

Food eats people!

Also, Momo could talk.

You said some very unkind things.

[CHATTERS]

[SNIFFS]

There is a storm coming.

A big one.

You're out of your mind, uncle.

The weather is perfect.
There's not a cloud in sight.

A storm is approaching from the north.

I suggest we alter our course
and head southwest.

We know the Avatar
is traveling northward,

so we will do the same.

Prince Zuko,
consider the safety of the crew.

The safety of the crew doesn't matter.

Finding the Avatar
is far more important

than any individual's safety.

He doesn't mean that.
He's just all worked up.

It's good.
It's perfect, I'm telling you.

[SWISHING]

I don't know if I like
the sound of that swishing.

Swishing means it's ripe.

It's the ripe juices
swishing around, huh?

I think it's true, Katara.

Swishing means it's ripe.

I just realized
we're out of money anyway.

Aww...

Out of food and out of money.

Now what are we supposed to do?

You could get a job, smart guy.

WOMAN: We shouldn't go out there.

Please! The fish can wait.

There's going to be a terrible storm.

Aw, you're crazy. It's a nice day.

No clouds, no wind, no nothing,

so quit your nagging, woman.

Maybe we should find some shelter.

Are you kidding? Shelter from what?

WOMAN: My joints say
there's going to be a storm,

a bad one.

Well, it's your joints
against my brain.

Then I hope your brain can find
someone else to haul that fish,

'cause I ain't coming!

Then I'll find a new fish hauler,

and pay him double what you get.

How do you like that?

I'll go.

You're hired.

What? You said get a job.

And he's paying double.

Double? Who told you that nonsense?

Oh. Looks like your uncle was right
about the storm after all.

Lucky guess.

Lieutenant,
you'd better learn some respect,

or I will teach it to you.

What do you know about respect?

The way you talk
to everyone around here,

from your hard-working crew
to your esteemed uncle,

shows you know nothing about respect.

You don't care about
anyone but yourself.

Then again, what should I expect
from a spoiled prince?

Easy now.

Enough!

We're all a bit tired
from being at sea so long.

I'm sure after a bowl of noodles,

everyone will feel much better.

I don't need your help
keeping order on my ship.

Sokka, maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

Look at the sky.

I said I was gonna do this job.

I can't back out just because
of some bad weather.

WOMAN: The boy with the tattoos
has some sense.

You should listen to him.

Boy with tattoos?

Airbender tattoos.

Well, I'll be a hog monkey's uncle.

You're the Avatar, ain't you?

That's right.

Well, don't be so smiley about it.

The Avatar disappeared
for a hundred years!

You turned your back on the world.

Don't yell at him!

Aang would never
turn his back on anyone.

Oh, he wouldn't, huh?

Then I guess I must have imagined

the last hundred years
of war and suffering.

Aang is the bravest person I know.

He has done nothing but help people,

and save lives since I met him.

It's not his fault he disappeared,
right, Aang?

Aang, what's wrong?

That's right! Keep flying!

You're a horrible old man!

Ehh!

Appa, yip yip!

Uhh!

Hey! They left
without saying good-bye.

Your friends ain't too polite,
are they?

I know. This one time, I was...

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get below deck.

I'm sorry for running away.

It's okay. That fisherman
was way out of line.

Actually, he wasn't.

What do you mean?

I don't want to talk about it.

It has to do with your dream,
doesn't it?

Talk to me.

Well, it's kind of a long story.

APPA: [GRUMBLING]

I'm gonna try to get
a little fire going.

I'll never forget the day
the monks told me I was the Avatar.

I was playing with some other kids
just outside the south wall.

I was trying to teach them
how to do the air scooter.

First you form a ball.
Then you've got to get on quick.

Ha ha ha!

Yeah! Ha ha ha!

Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

Okay, here goes.

Quick. Get on.

Whoa. Whoa...

Uhh!

You kind of have to balance on it
like it's a top.

Man, that's hard.

Where did you learn that trick, Aang?

I made it up.

Wow!

GYATSO: Aang, come with us.

We need to speak with you.

AANG: How do you know it's me?

We have known you were
the Avatar for some time.

Do you remember these?

Those were some of my favorite toys
when I was little.

You chose them
from among thousands of toys, Aang.

The toys you picked
were the four Avatar relics.

These items belonged to Avatars past.

Your own past lives.

I just chose them
because they seemed fun.

You chose them
because they were familiar.

Normally, we would have told you
of your identity when you turned 16.

But there are troubling signs.

Storm clouds are gathering.

I fear that war may be upon us,
young Avatar.

We need you, Aang.

I'm sick of taking his orders,

and I'm tired of chasing his Avatar.

I mean, who does Zuko think he is?

Do you really want to know?

General Iroh, we were just...

It's okay.

May I join you?

Of course, sir.

Try to understand,

my nephew is a complicated young man.

He has been through much.

Let me in!

Prince Zuko, what's wrong?

I want to go into the war chamber,

but the guard won't let me pass.

You're not missing anything. Trust me.

These meetings are dreadfully boring.

If I'm going to rule
this nation one day,

don't you think I need
to start learning as much as I can?

Very well,
but you must promise not to speak.

These old folks are a bit sensitive,
you know?

Thank you, uncle.

The Earth Kingdom defenses
are concentrated here,

a dangerous battalion
of their strongest earthbenders,

and fiercest warriors.

So, I am recommending
the 41st division.

But the 41st is entirely new recruits.

How do you expect them to defeat
a powerful Earth Kingdom battalion?

I don't.

They'll be used as a distraction

while we mount an attack
from the rear.

What better to use as bait
than fresh meat?

You can't sacrifice
an entire division like that!

Those soldiers love
and defend our nation.

How can you betray them?

Zuko was right, you see?

But it was not his place to speak out.

And there were dire consequences.

So you were upset
that you were the Avatar?

Why wouldn't you be excited about it?

Well, I didn't know
how to feel about it.

All I knew was that after I found out,

everything began changing.

AANG: Hey, not bad.

You guys have been practicing.

Not only that,

we made up a game you can play
with the air scooters.

Great!

What's going on?

Now that you're the Avatar,

it's kind of an unfair advantage

for whichever team you're on.

But I'm still the same.

Nothing has changed.

So, what? I can't play?

That's the only fair way.

Oh, okay...

Sorry, Aang.

Okay, now, who wants
to have Jinju on their team?

[LAUGHS]

Very interesting move, young one.

What do you mean?

Hey! Ha ha ha!

Ha ha ha!

You're playing games with him?

The Avatar should be training.

Aang has already
trained enough for today.

Time is short. Come with me.

I must test you
on some high-level techniques.

No. As long as I am his guardian,

I will decide when he trains

And when he gets his butt kicked
at Pai Sho.

Hmmph!

After Zuko's outburst in the meeting,

the Fire Lord became
very angry with him.

He said that Prince Zuko's
challenge of the general

was an act of complete disrespect.

And there was only one way
to resolve this.

Agni Kai. A fire duel.

That's right.

Zuko looked upon
the old general he had insulted,

and declared that he was not afraid.

But Zuko misunderstood.

When he turned to face his opponent,

he was surprised to see
it was not the general.

Zuko had spoken out
against the general's plan,

but by doing so
in the Fire Lord's war room,

it was the Fire Lord
whom he had disrespected.

Zuko would have to duel
his own father.

Then, just when
I was starting to feel better,

something worse happened.

Aang needs to have freedom and fun.

He needs to grow up as a normal boy.

Hmm. You cannot keep protecting him
from his destiny.

Gyatso, I know you mean well,

but you are letting your affection
for the boy cloud your judgment.

All I want is what is best for him.

But what we need
is what's best for the world.

You and Aang must be separated.

The Avatar will be sent away
to the Eastern Air Temple

to complete his training.

That's awful, Aang.

I don't know what to say.

How could they do that to me?

They wanted to take away
everything I knew,

and everyone I loved!

Whoa! Hot cinders.

I'm sorry I got so mad.

You have a right to be angry

after the monks
sent you away like that.

Well, that's not exactly
what happened.

[LAUGHING]

I was afraid and confused.

I didn't know what to do.

Aang?

I'm not going to let them
take you away from me.

Aang?

[GASPS]

I never saw Gyatso again.

[SCREAMING]

[ROARING]

Next thing I knew,
I was waking up in your arms

after you found me in the iceberg.

You ran away.

And then the Fire Nation
attacked our temple.

My people needed me,
and I wasn't there to help.

You don't know what would have...

The world needed me,
and I wasn't there to help.

-Aang...
-The fisherman was right.

I did turn my back on the world.

You're being too hard on yourself.

Even if you did run away,

I think it was meant to be.

If you had stayed,
you would have been killed

along with all the other airbenders.

You don't know that.

I know it's meant to be this way.

The world needs you now.

You give people hope.

[CHATTERS]

IROH: When Prince Zuko saw
that it was his father

who had come to duel him,

he begged for mercy.

Please, father,

I only had the Fire Nation's
best interests at heart.

I'm sorry I spoke out of turn.

You will fight for your honor.

I meant you no disrespect.

I am your loyal son.

Rise and fight, Prince Zuko.

I won't fight you.

You will learn respect,

and suffering will be your teacher.

IROH: I looked away.

ZUKO: [SCREAMING]

I always thought that Prince Zuko
was in a training accident.

It was no accident.

After the duel,

the Fire Lord said
that by refusing to fight,

Zuko had shown shameful weakness.

As punishment, he was banished,

and sent to capture the Avatar.

Only then could he return
with his honor.

So that's why he's so obsessed.

Capturing the Avatar
is the only chance he has

of things returning to normal.

Things will never return to normal,

but the important thing is,

the Avatar gives Zuko hope.

Help! Oh, please, help!

It's okay. You're safe.

But my husband isn't.

What do you mean? Where's Sokka?

They haven't returned.

They should have been back by now.

And this storm is becoming a typhoon.

They're caught out at sea!

I'm going to find them.

I'm going with you.

I'm staying here.

We'll be back soon. I promise.

[GRUMBLING]

Where were we hit?

I don't know.

Look!

ZUKO: The helmsman!

Aah!

Where are they?

Come on, Appa!

The boat! There!

The Avatar!

What do you want to do, sir?

Let him go.

We need to get this ship to safety.

Then we must head directly
into the eye of the storm.

I'm too young to die!

I'm not, but I still don't want to!

[GASPS]

Hang on to the rope!

Whoa! Whoa!

[BOTH GASPING]

Uncle, I am sorry.

Your apology is accepted.

Oh! You're alive!

You owe this boy an apology.

He doesn't have to apologize.

What if, instead of an apology,

I give him a free fish,
and we call it even?

Actually, I don't eat meat.

Fish ain't meat.

Seriously, you're still gonna pay me,
right?

Aah!

Katara, I think you were right before.

I'm done dwelling on the past.

Really?

I can't make guesses about
how things would have turned out

If I hadn't run away.

I'm here now, and I'm going
to make the most of it.

I don't think you're gonna have
those nightmares anymore.

If you weren't here now...

Well, I guess, I wouldn't be either.

Thank you for saving my life, Avatar.

Do you hear that?

It stopped raining.

[GRUMBLING]

AANG: Uh! Appa!

[CLOSING THEME PLAYING]

[BIRD CALLS]

Absolutely not.

The Yuyan archers stay here.

Your request is denied,
Commander Zhao.

Colonel Shinu, please reconsider.

Their precision is legendary.

The Yuyan can pin a fly
to a tree from 100 yards away

without killing it.

You're wasting their talents
using them as mere security guards.


 


I can do whatever I want
with their talents.

They're my archers,
and what I say goes.

But my search for the Avatar is...

Is nothing but a vanity project.

We're fighting a real war here,

and I need every man
I've got, commander.

But...

That's final!

I don't want to hear
another word about it.

[BIRD SCREECHES]

News from Fire Lord Ozai?

It appears I've been
promoted to admiral.

My request is now an order.

[COUGHING]

This should bring your fever down.

You know what I love
about Appa the most?

His sense of humor.

That's nice.

I'll tell him.

Ha ha ha!

Classic Appa.

How's Sokka doing?

Not so good.

Being out in that storm

really did a number on him.

[SHIVERING]

I couldn't find
any ginger root for the tea,

but I found a map.

There's a herbalist institute

on the top of that mountain.

We could probably
find a cure for Sokka there.

Aang, he's in no condition to travel.

Sokka just needs more rest.

I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow.

[COUGHING]

Not you, too.

Relax. It was just a little cough.

I'm fin...

[COUGHING]

That's how Sokka started yesterday.

Now look at him.

He thinks he's an earthbender.

Take that, you rock.

A few more hours
and you'll be talking nonsense, too.

I'm going to find some medicine.

Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot.

Keep an eye on them, guys.

Ha ha!

You guys are killing me.

We haven't been able to pick up
the Avatar's trail since the storm,

but if we continue
heading northeast...

What do they want?

Perhaps a sporting game of Pai Sho.

The hunt for the Avatar

has been given prime importance.

All information regarding the Avatar

must be reported
directly to Admiral Zhao.

Zhao has been promoted?

Well, good for him.

I've got nothing to report to Zhao.

Now get off my ship and let us pass.

Admiral Zhao is not allowing ships

in or out of this area.

Off my ship!

Excellent.

I take the pot.

But you're all improving.

I'm certain you will win
if we play again.

It says here
that the Avatar can create tornadoes

and run faster than the wind.

Pretty amazing.

Aw, that's just a bunch
of Fire Lord propaganda.

There's no way that's true.

[BLOWS HORN]

Katara, please, water.

Listen carefully, Momo.

I need you to take this
to the river and fill it with water.

[HEARING GIBBERISH]

Got it?

Hello. I'm sorry
to barge in like this,

but I need some medicine
for my friends.

They have fevers
and they've been coughing...

Settle down, young man.

Your friends are going to be fine.

I've been up here
for over 40 years, you know.

Used to be others,
but they all left years ago.

Now it's just me and Miyuki.

That's nice.

Wounded Earth Kingdom troops
still come by now and again.

Brave boys,

and thanks to my remedies,

they always leave in better shape
than when they arrived.

That's nice. Are you almost done?

Hold on.

I just need to add
one last ingredient.

Oh, sandalwood?

Oh, yes... No, that won't do.

Banana leaf? Eh, nope.

Ginger root?

Uh-uh.

Oh, where is that pesky little plant?

Is everything OK?

It's been almost an hour

and you haven't given
the men an order.

I don't care what they do.

Don't give up hope yet.

You can still find the Avatar
before Zhao.

How, uncle?

With Zhao's resources,

it's just a matter of time

before he captures the Avatar.

My honor, my throne, my country...

I'm about to lose them all.

Oh, here's what I was looking for.

Plum blossom.

Finally. Thanks for all your help.

Hands off.

What do you think you're doing?

Taking the cure to my friends.

Oh! Ha ha! This isn't a cure.

It's Miyuki's dinner.

Plum blossom is her favorite.

What about my friends?

Well, all they need
is some frozen wood frogs.

There's plenty of them
down in the valley swamp.

What am I supposed to do
with frozen frogs?

Why, suck on them, of course.

Suck on them?

The frog skin excretes a substance

that'll cure your friends,

but make sure you get plenty.

Once those little critters thaw out,

they're useless.

You're insane, aren't you?

That's right.

Well, don't stand there all day.

Go!

Uh! Whoa!

Uh, I think you dropped this.

Aah!

A frog!

So this is the great Avatar,

master of all the elements.

I don't know how
you've managed to elude

the Fire Nation for 100 years,

but your little game
of hide and seek is over.

I've never hidden from you.

Untie me and I'll fight you right now.

Uh, no.

Tell me, how does it feel
to be the only airbender left?

Do you miss your people?

Oh, don't worry.

You won't be killed like they were.

See, if you die, you'll just be reborn

and the Fire Nation will have to begin

its search for the Avatar
all over again.

So I'll keep you alive,
but just barely.

Blow all the wind you want.

Your situation is futile.

There is no escaping this fortress

and no one is coming to rescue you.

[COUGHING]

Water.

Momo should be back any minute.

No, Momo.

Water.

Wa-ter.

Aang, what in the world
is taking you so long?

All clear.

All clear.

Go on in.

We are the sons and daughters
of fire, the superior element,

until today, only one thing
stood in our path to victory...

The Avatar!

I am here to tell you
that he is now my prisoner!

[CHEERING]

This is the year Sozin's Comet
returns to grant us its power!

[CROWD CHEERING]

This is the year the Fire Nation

breaks through
the walls of Ba Sing Se,

and burns the city to the ground.

[CHEERING]

What? No!

Don't leave, frogs. My friends
are sick and they need you.

Please go back to being frozen.

[FROGS CROAKING]

[PUNCHES BEING THROWN]

[PUNCHES BEING THROWN]

Aah!

Aah!

Who are you? What's going on?

Are you here to rescue me?

I'll take that as a yes.

My frogs!

Come back!

And stop thawing out!

Wait!

My friends need to
suck on those frogs!

How many times
do I have to tell you, Momo?

We need water.

Wa-ter.

Oh, forget it.

Aang, please hurry.

Who is this Aang kid
you keep talking about, your highness?

I want a full transcription
of my speech

sent to the Fire Lord,

Along with glowing testimonials

from all of the ranking officers
present, and...

[MEN GRUNTING]

[CROAKS]

Sir, shall I hold off
sending that speech to the Fire Lord?

[NOISY CHIMES RINGING]

There. On the wall!

Aah!

The Avatar has escaped!

Close all the gates immediately.

Stay close to me.

Aah!

Aah!

[YELLS]

Take this.

Jump on my back!

Give me the next one!

Hold your fire!

The Avatar must be captured alive.

Open the gate.

Admiral, what are you doing?

Let them out.

Now!

How could you let them go?

A situation like this requires...
Precision.

Do you have a clear shot?

Knock out the thief.

I'll deliver him to the Fire Lord
along with the Avatar.

Quick! Recover the Avatar!

[CROAKS]

You know what the worst part

about being born
over 100 years ago is?

I miss all the friends
I used to hang out with.

Before the war started,

I used to always
visit my friend, Kuzon.

The two of us, we'd get in and out

of so much trouble together.

He was one of the best friends
I ever had...

And he was from the Fire Nation,
just like you.

If we knew each other back then,

do you think
we could have been friends, too?

Where have you been, Prince Zuko?

You missed music night.

Lieutenant Jee sang
a stirring love song.

I'm going to bed.

No disturbances.

[PLAYING INSTRUMENT]

Suck on these.

It'll make you feel better.

Aang, how was your trip?

Did you make any new friends?

No.

I don't think I did.

Mm!

This is tasty.

Mm, mm!

[CROAKS]

Ptooey!

Aah!

Look!

He is taunting us.

You are so going to be dinner.

Hey, where's the fishing line?

Oh, I didn't think
you would need it, Sokka.

Ah, it's all tangled.

Not tangled, woven.

I made you a necklace, Katara.

I thought since you lost
your other one...

Thanks, Aang.


 


I love it.

Great, Aang.

Maybe instead of saving the world,

you can go
into the jewelry-making business.

I don't see why I can't do both.

Huh!

Stop taunting me!

Uhh!

KATARA: So, how do I look?

You mean, all of you
or just your neck...

I mean, because they both look great.

Smoochie smoochie.

Someone's in love.

I, well...

Stop teasing him, Sokka.

Aang's just a good friend,

a sweet little guy, just like Momo.

Thanks.

[GROWLING]

Someone's being attacked
by a platypus bear!

Well, hello there.

Nice day, isn't it?

Make noise! He'll run off!

No, play dead! He'll lose interest!

Whoa, close one. Ha ha ha.

Run downhill, then climb a tree!

No, punch him in the bill!

And then run in zig-zags.

No need.

It's going to be fine.

Whoa, there.

[ROARS]

Mmm, lunch.

[SNIFFS]

Lucky for you we came along.

Thanks, but everything
was already under control.

Not to worry.

Aunt Wu predicted
I'd have a safe journey.

Aunt who?

No, Aunt Wu.

She's the fortune-teller
from my village.

Awful nice knowing your future.

Wow, it must be.

That explains why you were so calm.

But the fortune-teller was wrong.

You didn't have a safe journey.

You were almost killed.

But I wasn't.

All right, have a good one.

Oh, and Aunt Wu said if I met
any travelers, to give them this.

Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu
and learn our fortunes.

It could be fun.

Oh, come on.
Fortune-telling is nonsense.

What do you know?

An umbrella.

[THUNDER]

That proves it.

No, it doesn't.

You can't really tell the future.

I guess you're not
really getting wet, then.

Whoa... Aah!

Of course she predicted

it was gonna rain.

The sky has been gray all day.

Just admit you might be wrong,

and you can come under the umbrella.

Look, I'm gonna
predict the future now.

It's going to keep drizzling.

See?

Not everyone has the gift, Sokka.

Aah!

[QUACKING]

Aunt Wu is expecting you.

Really?

Pfft.

My name is Meng,
and I'm Aunt Wu's assistant.

Well, hello there.

Hello.

Can I get you some tea

or some of Aunt Wu's
special bean curd puffs?

I'll try a curd puff.

Just a second.

So, what's your name?

Aang.

That rhymes with Meng,

and you've got some pretty big ears,
don't you?

I guess.

Don't be modest.

They're huge.

Well, Aang, it's very nice
to meet you...

Very nice.

Likewise.

I can't believe we're here

in the house of nonsense.

Try to keep an open mind, Sokka.

There are things in this world

that just can't be explained.

Wouldn't it be nice to have
some insight into your future?

It would be nice
to have some bean curd puffs.

Oh, Meng!

Aunt Wu says
I'm going to meet my true love!

He's going to give me
a rare panda lily.

That's so romantic.

I wonder if my true love
will give me a rare flower.

Good luck with that.

[CHUCKLE]

Is that the big-eared guy
who Aunt Wu predicted you'd marry?

Aah!

Enjoy your snack.

Welcome, young travelers.

Now, who's next?

Don't be shy.

I guess that's me.

Not bad, not bad.

Mmm! Mmm!

Hmm?

I'm good on puffs.

Hmm.

So, what do you think
they're talking about back there?

Boring stuff, I'm sure.

Love, who she's gonna marry,

how many babies she's gonna have.

Yeah, dumb stuff like that.

Well, I gotta find a bathroom.

AUNT WU: Your palms are so smooth.

Do you use moisturizer?

KATARA: Actually,
I have this special seaweed lotion.

I could get you some if you want.

So, do you see anything
interesting in my love line?

I see a great romance for you...

The man you're going to marry.

Tell me more!

I can see
that he's a very powerful bender.

Looks like someone
had a pretty good bathroom break.

Yeah, when I was in there...

I don't even want to know.

Who's next?

OK, let's get this over with.

Your future is full
of struggle and anguish,

most of it self-inflicted.

But you didn't read
my palms or anything.

I don't need to.

It's written all over your face.

You there, come with me.

This is the most reliable method
of telling your fortune.

The bones never lie.

Go on. Pick one.

Now throw it on the fire.

The heat makes cracks in the bones,

and I read the bone cracks
to tell your destiny.

AANG: Wow, that's a big crack.

I've never seen this before.

[GASPS]

Oh, my!

Your destiny... This is incredible.

You will be involved
in a great battle...

An awesome conflict
between the forces of good and evil.

A battle whose outcome will determine
the fate of the whole world.

Yeah, yeah. I knew that already,

But did it say anything about a girl?

A girl?

You want to know about love?

Yes!

I'm sorry, but I didn't see anything.

Oh, look!

I must have missed something.

Right here.

It says, "trust your heart, and you
will be with the one you love."

Really?

Thank you, Aunt Wu!

SOKKA: Well, now you got to see
for yourselves

that fortune-telling
is just a big, stupid hoax.

You're just saying that

because you're gonna make yourself
unhappy your whole life.

That woman is crazy!

My life will be calm and happy
and joyful!

Ow!

That doesn't prove anything.

Well, I liked my predictions.

Certain things
are gonna turn out very well.

They sure are.

Why?

What did she tell you?

Some stuff.

You'll find out.

What's with the sky?

We're waiting for Aunt Wu
to come and read the clouds

to predict the fate
of the whole village.

That cloud kind of looks
like a fluffy bunny.

You better hope that's not a bunny.

The fluffy bunny cloud
forecasts doom and destruction.

Do you even hear yourself?

The cloud reading
will tell us if Mount Makapu

will remain dormant for another year

or if it will erupt.

We used to have
a tradition once a year

of going up the mountain

to check the volcano ourselves,

But ever since Aunt Wu

moved to the village 20 years ago,

we have a tradition of not doing that.

I can't believe
you would trust your lives

to that crazy
old woman's superstition!

Shh! She's coming.

[CHEERING]

Hey, Aang,

don't you think that cloud
looks like a flower, huh?

Sure, I guess.

Hey, Katara, don't you think
that cloud looks like a flower?

Shh!

Bending arrow cloud...

Good crops this year.
Nice, big harvest.

Darn good news!

Wavy moon-shaped cloud... Let's see.

Gonna be a great year for twins.

-Yes!
-Yes!

And a cumulus cloud with a twisty
nub coming off the end of it...

The village will not be destroyed
by the volcano this year!

[CHEERING]

Since I got you here,

there's something I want to tell you.

I like you, but more than normal.

Never mind.

Hi, Aunt Wu.

Sorry to bother you.

Anytime.

About this man I'm supposed to marry...

Is he gonna be handsome?

Oh, I hope he's tall.

Ah. You want another reading.

Yes, please.

I can't believe all these saps.

Someone really needs
to scream some sense at them.

They seem happy, Sokka.

Not for long.

I'm gonna prove
Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense.

Hey, you,

I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear
those red shoes, didn't she?

Yeah, she said
I'd be wearing red shoes

when I met my true love.

Uh-huh.

And how many times
have you worn those shoes

since you got that fortune?

Every day.

Then of course it's gonna come true!

Really? You think so?

I'm so excited!

Uhh!

[SQUAWKING]

Aah! Uhh!

And then you'll have
your third great grandchild

before quietly
passing away in your sleep.

Is that enough information for you?

Wow. Thanks, Aunt Wu.

Oh, wait. One more thing.

How warmly should I dress tomorrow?

You want me to do a reading for that?

I don't care what Aunt Wu told you!

You have to take a bath sometime!

[CHUCKLING]

So, Sokka, you know some stuff
about ladies, right?

Some stuff?

You've come to the right place.

What can I do you for?

Well, there's this girl...

[GIGGLING]

I think I know who you mean.

You do? And you're OK with it?

Of course I am.

And to tell you the truth,

I've been picking up
a subtle vibe that she likes you, too.

She does?

Oh, yeah. She's crazy about you.

All you have to do now
is not mess it up.

Well, how do I do that?

The number one mistake
nice guys like you make...

Being too nice.

You can be too nice?

Yep. If you want to
keep her interested,

you have to act aloof,

Like you don't really care
one way or the other.

Well, OK.

Hey, Aang. I was wondering...

See you later.

Hmm.

Wow. That kid is good.

And you'll be fine
as long as you've got a scarf.

Bye-bye, now.

OK, OK. But one more thing.

All right. What is it?

Should I eat a mango or a papaya

for breakfast tomorrow?

Papaya.

Oh, I hate papaya.

Oh. Hey, Katara.

I didn't see you there.

Hey, Aang.

That's OK.

I'm busy with my own stuff.

[QUACK]

Ugh. Papaya, please.

So, papaya.

Uh-huh. Would you like some?

You know me.

I don't really care what I eat.

OK, then.

See you later.

Ugh!

Maybe aloof isn't my style.

Oh, a panda lily.

Did you see that?

Excuse me. Where can a guy
find one of those things?

SOKKA: I can't believe you're
dragging me all the way up here

For a stupid flower.

Not just any flower... A panda lily.

I've seen it in action,
and, boy, does it work.

Flowers are fine once you're married,

but at this early stage,

it's critical that you maintain
maximum aloofness.

But my heart
is telling me to get this flower,

And Aunt Wu said
if I trusted my heart,

I would be with the one I love.

What? Don't tell me
you believe in that stuff, too.

Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet.

Why should she be wrong about love?

There, on the rim!

[GASP]

Oh, no.

Aunt Wu was wrong.

Those people all think they're safe.

We've got to warn them.

There's no time to walk.

Grab on.

Aah!

Hi, Katara.

Can you believe she won't let me in?

And after all the business
I've given her?

But she doesn't even charge.

I know, but still.

Well, we have other things
to worry about.

Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano.

Sokka, you tried to convince me
she was wrong before.

It's gonna take an awful lot
to change my...

[RUMBLING]

Oh, no.

SOKKA: Everyone, that volcano
is gonna blow any second!

Aunt Wu was wrong!

Yeah, yeah. We know
you don't believe in Aunt Wu,

Mr. Science and Reason lover.

If you won't listen to him,
maybe you'll listen to me.

I want to believe Aunt Wu and her
predictions as much as you do,

but my brother and Aang saw the lava

with their own eyes.

Well, I heard Aunt Wu's prediction
with my own ears.

Please listen to us!

You are all in danger,

and we have to get out of here!

You can't rely
on Aunt Wu's predictions!

You have to take fate
into your own hands!

Look!

Can your fortune-telling explain that?

Heh. Can your science
explain why it rains?

Yes! Yes, it can!

They just won't listen to reason.

But they will listen to Aunt Wu.

I know. That's the problem.

Well, it's about to become
the solution.

We're taking fate in our own hands.

First, I need to borrow
Aunt Wu's cloud-reading book.

[CHATTERS] Shh.

We don't want anyone to hear us.

Oh! Oh, I didn't see you there.

You don't like me, do you?

Of course I like you.

But not the way I like you.

Oh. I guess not.

It's OK.

It's just really hard
when you like someone,

but they don't think of you that way.

I know what you mean.

She's beautiful, by the way.

Huh?

That water tribe girl.

I can see why you like her so much.

She's sweet, she's a bender,

and her hair seems so manageable.

Don't worry.

You're gonna meet a great guy

who's gonna completely fall for you.

I know it.

Thanks.

Wait.

Don't you want this?

How did you know?

I've kind of been stalking you. Heh.

Oh, thanks...

I guess.

[GRUMBLING]

AANG: Clouds are made
of water and air,

So between the two of us,

we ought to be able to bend them
into any shape we want.

I found it...
The symbol for volcanic doom.

[GRUMBLING]

SOKKA: Aunt Wu, look!

Something's happening in the clouds!

That's very strange.

It shouldn't... Oh, my!

AANG: We could still save the village
if we act fast.

Sokka has a plan.

Lava is gonna flow
downhill to this spot.

If we can dig a deep enough trench,

we can channel all the lava
away from the village

to the river.

If any of you are earth benders,
come with me.

I'm an earth bender!

I'm not!

Everybody else, grab a shovel.

[CROWD GASPS]

Come on! We've got to hurry.

[SHOUTING]

[GASP]

Dig faster! Dig faster!

Everyone needs to evacuate!

We'll come for you when it's safe!

[CHATTERS]

KATARA: It's too much.

It's gonna overflow!

Aah!

Uhh!

Aah!

Man...

Sometimes I forget
what a powerful bender that kid is.

Wait, what did you just say?

Nothing. Just that Aang
is one powerful bender.

I suppose he is.

AANG: By the way,
we kind of borrowed your book.

So you messed with the clouds,
did you?

Ha ha ha! Very clever.

No offense, but I hope this
has taught everyone a lesson

about not relying too much
on fortune-telling.

But Aunt Wu predicted
the village wouldn't be destroyed,

and it wasn't.

She was right, after all.

I hate you.

It's OK, Sokka.

Everything's gonna be all right.

Can I ask you something?

Of course, honey.

You didn't really see love
in my fortune, did you?

You just told me
what I wanted to hear.

I'll tell you a little secret,
young airbender.

Just as you reshaped those clouds,

you have the power
to shape your own destiny.

KATARA: Good-bye, everyone!

It was so nice to meet you!

Take care, Meng.

Take care!

Floozy.

Hey, look!
A sword made out of a whale's tooth!

Let me see that.

This is a Water Tribe weapon.

See if you can find anything else.

Did someone lose something?

No, we found something.

It's burned.

There was a battle.

Water Tribe warriors ambushed
a group of firebenders.


 


The firebenders fought back,

but the warriors
drove them down this hill.

So then what happened?

I don't know. The trail ends here.

Wait! Look!

It's one of our boats!

KATARA: Is this dad's boat?

No, but it's from his fleet.

Dad was here.

Ahh!

See, Prince Zuko?

A moment of quiet is good
for your mental well-being.

-[THUDDING]
-Unh!

[GRUMBLES]

-Watch out!
-[GROWLING]

Get back!

We're after a stowaway.

There are no stowaways on my ship.

[SNARLING]

[PANTING]

He's paralyzed.

Only temporarily.

The toxins will wear off
in about an hour.

But by then, he'll be in jail,

and I'll have my money.

But how did you find him on my ship?

My shirshu can smell a rat
a continent away.

Well, I'm impressed.

Very impressed.

Sokka.

I'm coming with you.

You're not old enough to go to war,
Sokka. You know that.

I'm strong. I'm brave.

I can fight!

Please, dad?

Being a man is knowing
where you're needed the most,

and for you right now,
that's here protecting your sister.

I don't understand.

Someday you will.

I'm gonna miss you so much.

[SOBBING]

Who's there?

Sokka?

Bato?

Who the what now?

Bato!

Sokka! Katara!

It is so good to see you two.

Oh. You've grown so much.

Hi, I'm Aang.

-Where's dad?
-Is he here?

No. He and the other warriors

should be in the eastern
Earth Kingdom by now.

[WIND BLOWING]

[SHUDDERS]

This is no place for a reunion.

Let's get inside.

After I was wounded,

your father carried me to this abbey.

The sisters
have cared for me ever since.

Superior, these are Hakoda's children.

They've been traveling
with the Avatar.

I found them by my boat.

Young Avatar, it gives me great joy

to be in your presence.

Welcome to our abbey.

Thank you.
It's truly an honor to be here.

If there's anything...

What smells so good, Bato?

[SNIFFING]

The sisters craft ointments
and perfumes.

Perfume? Maybe we could
dump some on Appa,

because he stinks so much.

Am I right?

[PERSON COUGHS]

You have your father's wit.

Bato, it looks like home!

Everything's here, even the pelts.

Yeah. Nothing's cozier
than dead animal skins.

Ack!

No way! Stewed sea prunes?

Help yourself.

Dad could eat
a whole barrel of these things.

[SNIFFS] Ugh!

Bato, is it true you
and dad lassoed an arctic hippo?

It was your father's idea.

He just dragged me along.

Well, the hippo did the dragging.

Hey, I ride animals, too!

One time, there was
this giant eel, and I...

So, who was it that came up
with the great blubber fiasco?

You knew about that?

Everyone does.

What's that story?

It's a long one, Aang.

Some other time.

You and dad had
so many hilarious adventures.

Not all of which
were hilarious at the time,

but everything's funny with hindsight.

Aang!

Please put that down.
It's ceremonial and very fragile.

SOKKA: Was it you or dad
that put an octopus on your head

and convinced gran-gran
you were a water spirit?

Your dad wore the octopus,
but I did the spooky voice.

[PEOPLE CHEERING]

MAN: Aah! Unh...

[GRUNTING]

Out of my way! Step aside, filth.

He means no offense.

I'm certain you bathe regularly.

I need to talk to you.

Well, if it isn't my new friends,

Angry Boy and Uncle Lazy.

Heh heh heh!

[CHEERING]

Your beast trashed my ship.

You have to pay me back.

Well, I'd love to help you out,

but I'm a little short on money.

Drinks on me!

[CHEERING AND SHOUTING]

Money isn't what I had in mind.

I need you to find someone.

What happened?
Your girlfriend run off on you?

It's not the girl I'm after.

It's the bald monk
she's traveling with.

Whatever you say.

If you find them,

I'll consider the damage
to my ship paid for.

Ha! Forget it.

Plus, we'll pay your weight in gold.

Make it your weight,
and we got a deal.

Ha ha ha! You got it!

Get on!

BATO: There's something
I should tell you kids.

I'm expecting a message
from your father.

-Really?
-When?

Any day now.

Your father said he'd send a message

when they found the rendezvous point.

If you wait here
until the message arrives,

you can come with me
and see your father again.

It's been over two years
since we've seen dad.

That would be so incredible.

Katara!

KATARA: I do really miss him.

It would be great to see dad.

BATO: It's been far too long,
hasn't it?

I'm not sure when word will arrive,

but when it does...

It would be great, but we can't.

We have to take Aang
to the North Pole first.

Even if we had time
to wait for the message,

who knows how far we'd have to travel?

We don't have time for a long detour.

I'm sure your father would understand,

and be proud that his children
are helping the Avatar.

I can't believe they would leave me.

[ANIMAL NEIGHING]

I'm looking for Bato
of the Water Tribe.

Uh, I know Bato.

Make sure he gets this.

It's the map
to Sokka and Katara's dad.

Hey, everyone.

Sorry I was gone so long.

Hey, Aang. I didn't notice you left.

Yep. But now I'm back.

Sure could go for some
delicious sea prunes.

Mmm! Yum yum! Mmm!

[CHOKES]

Mmm!

[ROARING]

Out for a bit of fresh air, are we?

ZUKO: We're looking for someone.

I hope it's not Miyuki.

Miyuki, did you get in trouble
with the Fire Nation again?

[MEOWS]

The Avatar's been through here.

Let's keep moving.

Aha! I caught you.

You should be ashamed of yourself.

Littering in the courtyard.

I'm sorry. I'll take care of this.

BATO: This ship is sentimental to me.

It was built by my father.

[WHISTLING]

SOKKA: Is this the boat
he took you ice dodging in?

BATO: Yep, and it's got
the scar to prove it.

Ha! How about you, Sokka?

You must have some good stories
from your first time ice dodging.

He never got to go.

Dad left before he was old enough.

Oh, I forgot. You were too young.

What's ice dodging?

It's a rite of passage
for young Water Tribe members.

When you turn 14, your dad takes you...

You know what?

You're about to find out.

[SCREAMING]

ZUKO: Why are we stopping?

Because the girl must have
spent a lot of time here.

We have no time for this.

Hey, watch it!

-Heh heh heh!
-Oh, look. He likes you.

Care to hear your fortune, handsome?

At my age, there's really
only one big surprise left,

and I'd just as soon
leave it a mystery.

[SNARLING]

BATO: Ice dodging is a ceremonial test

of wisdom, bravery, and trust.

In our village,
it was done by weaving a boat

through a field of icebergs.

How are we supposed
to ice dodge without ice?

You'll be dodging... Those.

Sokka, you steer and call the shots.

Lead wisely.

Katara, you secure the mainsail.

The winds can be brutal. So be brave.

Aang, you control the jib.

Without your steady hand,
we all go down.

Your position is about trust.

I know that! Why wouldn't I know that?

I'm the Avatar! I know about trust.

For this to be done right,
I cannot help.

You pass or fail on your own.

Aang, ease up on the jib.

Katara, steady.

Aang, less sail.

Unh! Katara, give him room.

Unh!

Aang, helm to lee. Helm to lee!

What does that even mean?

SOKKA: [GRUNTS]

[STRAINING]

Great job!

There's no way through!

We can make it!

Sokka, you've already proven yourself.
Maybe we should...

Aang! I'm gonna need air in that sail!

Katara, I want you to bend
as much water as you can

between us and those rocks.

Now!

[GROANS]

[SIGHS]

The spirits of water bear witness
to these marks.

For Sokka, the mark of the wise...

The same mark your father earned.

For Katara, the mark of the brave.

Your courage inspires us.

And for Aang, the mark of the trusted.

You are now an honorary member
of the Water Tribe.

I can't.

Of course you can.

No. You can't trust me.

Aang, what are you talking about?

A messenger gave this to me for Bato.

You have to understand.
I was afraid you wouldn't...

This is the map to our father!

You had it the whole time?

How could you?

Well, you can go to
the North Pole on your own.

I'm going to find dad.

BATO: Now, Sokka, I think you should...

Katara, are you with me?

I'm with you, Sokka.

Good luck.

Okay. You too.

Guess I should be moving on.

That would be best.

I'm an idiot, Momo.

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

[ROARING]

We're getting close.

[WOLF HOWLING]

That wolf sounds so sad.

It's probably wounded.

No. It's been separated from the pack.

I understand that pain.

It's how I felt when
the Water Tribe warriors

had to leave me behind.

They were my family,

and being apart from them
was more painful than my wounds.

Sokka?

We need to go back.

I want to see dad,

but helping Aang is where
we're needed the most.

You're right.

Your father will understand,

and I know he's proud of you.

Thanks, Bato.

I know where to go from here.

Take this in case you want to find us.

I'll leave a message
at the rendezvous point.

Looks like we're going alone, guys.

Avatar! You must leave.

Okay, I get it.
Everybody wants me gone.

A group of people came to the abbey
looking for you.

Who?

A fierce-looking woman
with a horrible monster,

and a young man with a scar.

Zuko.

The beast was using the scent
of a necklace to follow you.

A necklace?

[GASPS] Katara!

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

[ROARING]

So this is your girlfriend.

No wonder she left.

She's way too pretty for you.

Where is he? Where's the Avatar?

We split up. He's long gone.

How stupid do you think I am?

Pretty stupid. Run!

BOTH: Aah! Unh!

ZUKO: What are we supposed to do now?

It's seeking a different scent,

perhaps something
that the Avatar held.

[SNIFFING]

[SCREAMING]

ZUKO: What's it doing?

It's just going in a circle.

[ALL YELLING]

-Aang!
-Up!

[GROWLING]

Hah!

Aargh!

-Aah!
-Unh!

Oof!

Unh!

Come on, get up!

[GROWLING]

Unh!

[GROANS]

[GASPS]

Aah!

I'm starting to get some feeling back.

Ow...

[SNIFFS]

Ahh...

You've got something I want.

Aah!

Unh!

Oof!

[SNIFFS] Ugh.

[SNIFFS]

That thing sees with its nose.

Let's give him something to look at.

The perfume?

Ohh!

June, no!

Uncle?

I didn't see you get hit
with the tongue.

Shh...

So... Where do we go?

We're getting you to the North Pole.

Yeah. We've lost
too much time as it is.

Don't you want to see your father?

Of course we do, Aang,

but you're our family, too,

and right now, you need us more.

And we need you.

I wish I could give you
a little piece of home, Katara,

something to remind you...

-I'll be okay.
-Still, just a little trinket.

Maybe something like... This?

Aang! How'd you get that?

Zuko asked me
to be sure I got it to you.

Oh, that's so sweet of Zuko.

Would you give him a kiss for me
when you see him?

Sure.

Mwah.

[CLOSING THEME PLAYING]

This should give us a good idea
of what's around here.

See if you can find a menu.

I'm starving.

I bet we'll find something
to eat here...

The Fire Days Festival.

Fire Nation cultural exhibits,

jugglers, benders, magicians...

This would be a great place for me
to study some real firebenders.


 


You might want to rethink that.

Look at this.

AANG: Hey, a poster of me!

A wanted poster.

This is bad.

I think we better keep moving.

I have to learn firebending
at some point,

and this could be my only chance
to watch some masters up close.

I guess we could go check it out.

What?

You want to walk into
a Fire Nation town

when they're all fired up
with all their, you know, fire?

We'll wear disguises.

And if it looks like trouble,
we'll leave.

Yeah.

Because we always leave
before we get into trouble.

[GROWLING]

You guys stay out of sight here
while we go to the festival.

[COOING]

Ready disguises.

It's like you're a whole
different person.

Let's go!

Ha ha ha ha!

KATARA: I think we need
some new disguises.

Where are we gonna get
masks like that?

Get your genuine
Fire-Festival masks here!

That was surprisingly easy.

Hey, there's some food.

Finally!

What do you have?

Flaming fire flakes.

Best in town.

I'll take 'em.

Mmm! Mmm!

[SCREAMING]

Oh, hot, hot!

Flaming fire flakes, hot.

What do you know?

Hey, look at this!

Don't worry, loyal citizens,

no one can surprise the Fire Lord!

-Oh, no!
-Look out!

[CHEERING]

KATARA: Aang, hold on.

Where are we going?

I don't know...

But there's a big crowd,
so it must be good.

SOKKA: Knowing the Fire Nation,

it's probably an execution.

[APPLAUSE]

I gotta learn that trick.

Thank you!

For my next trick,

I need a volunteer from the audience.

Ooh, ooh! Me! me!

What do you think you're doing?

I want to get a closer look.

It's better that we don't attract
any attention to ourselves.

How about you, little lady?

Uh...

Aw, she's shy.

Let's give her some
encouragement, folks.

[CHEERING]

Aw, that could have been me.

This next trick is called
Taming the Dragon!

You will be my captured princess.

Don't worry, young maiden!

I will tame this fiery beast!

It's too strong!

I can't hold it!

We gotta help her!

No, we don't want to make a scene.

The rope... It's breaking!

[SCREAMS]

Hey, you trying to upstage me, kid?

[BOOING]

MAN: Hey! That kid's the Avatar!

I think it's time to go.

MAN: Follow me!

I can get you out of here!

GUARD: There they are!

Over there!

I'm calling Appa.

SOKKA: I hope he can really hear
that bison whistle!

MAN: This way!

OK, not this way.

[MEN COUGHING]

Huh?

[GROWLS]

AANG: Appa, down here!

[GROWLS]

[CHEERING]

Beautiful!

[LAUGHTER]

Nice touch setting off the fireworks.

You seem to really know
your explosives.

I'm familiar.

You're a Fire Nation soldier.

Was.

My name's Chey.

CHEY: I serve a man...

More than a man, really,

he's a myth...

But he's real, a living legend...

Jeong Jeong the Deserter.

He was a Fire Nation general.

Or wait... Was he an admiral?

He was very highly ranked. We get it.

Yeah! Way up there!

But he couldn't take
the madness anymore.

He's the first person ever
to leave the army and live.

I'm the second, but you don't
get to be a legend for that.

It's OK, though.

Jeong Jeong's a firebending genius.

Some say he's mad,

but he's not.

He's enlightened.

You mean there's a firebender out here

who's not with the Fire Lord?

We've gotta go see him!

He can train me!

We're not gonna go find
some crazy firebender.

CHEY: He's not crazy!

He's a genius!

And he's the perfect person
to train the Avatar.

That's why I followed you
into the festival.

Look, thanks for the help,

but we're leaving for the North Pole
in the morning.

Sokka, this could be my only chance
to meet a firebending master

who would actually be willing
to teach me.

It can't hurt just to talk to him.

That's what you said about
going to the festival!

Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me?

[GASPS]

Aagh!

[GASPS]

Don't move.

[LOWING]

Jeong Jeong told you
not to look for Avatar.

Hold on. You know these guys?

Oh, yeah.

Lin Ye's an old buddy.

Right, Lin Ye?

Shut up. Keep moving.

[COOING]

LIN YE: Go on. He sees you only.

Oh, that's OK.

We can chat later.

Is that where Jeong Jeong is?

I need to talk to him right away.

No. You wait there.

Go, now!

Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

He's a great man.

A great man!

ZHAO: So, the Avatar was here

and you let him slip away?

Yes, sir.

But other than that,
the festival went off without a hitch.

[GRUNTS]

No fights. Theft was way down.

I don't care
about your local crime rates!

Which way did they go?

They headed into the forest.

Up the river, I suspect.

Ready the riverboats.

We're going after the Avatar.

What happened?
Can I see Jeong Jeong now?

He won't see you.

He's very angry
that I brought you here.

He wants you to leave immediately.

Finally! Let's hit the road.

Why won't he see me?

He says you're not ready.

Says you haven't mastered
waterbending and earthbending yet.

Wait, how does he know that?

He saw the way you walked into camp.

He can tell.

I'm going in anyway.

[INHALES]

Get out!

Master, I need to learn firebending.

Only a fool seeks his own destruction.

I am the Avatar.

-It's my destiny to...
-Destiny?

What would a boy know of destiny?

If a fish lives its whole life
in this river,

does he know the river's destiny?

No!

Only that it runs on and on
out of his control.

He may follow where it flows,

but he cannot see the end.

He cannot imagine the ocean.

OK...

But it's the Avatar's duty

to master all of
the bending disciplines.

To master the bending disciplines,

you must first master
discipline itself.

But you have no interest in this,

so I have no interest in you.

Now, get out.

Please, I have to learn.

This could be my only chance.

Are you deaf?

How can I teach you
if you refuse to listen?

Before learning firebending,

you must learn water and earth.

Water is cool and soothing.

Earth is steady and stable.

But fire...

Fire is alive.

It breathes, it grows.

Without the bender,
a rock will not throw itself.

But fire will spread

and destroy everything in its path

if one does not have
the will to control it!

That is its destiny.

You are not ready!

You are too weak!

You think I am weak?

Avatar Roku!

No, no!

I did not mean that.

I have mastered the elements

a thousand times
in a thousand lifetimes.

Now, I must do it once again.

You will teach the Avatar firebending.

Yes, yes.

I will teach you.

AANG: Really?

That's great!

[GROANS]

Widen your stance.

Wider!

Bend your knees.

Now, concentrate.

Good. Good!

Wait. What do I do now?

Silence! Talking is not concentrating.

Look at your friend. Is she talking?

Even that oaf knows to concentrate
on what he's doing.

SOKKA: Hey!

But what am I concentrating on?

Feel the heat of the sun.

It is the greatest source of fire,

yet it is in complete balance
with nature.

So, when do I get to make some fire?

Concentrate!

[SIGHS]

[LAUGHTER]

Are we coming up here
so I don't burn anything

with my fire blasts?

No fire yet.

What?

Power in firebending
comes from the breath.

That is why you must master
proper breath control.

You brought me up here to breathe?

Assume your stance.

Wider.

-You're not even look...
-Wider!

Now, inhale through the nose
and exhale through the mouth...

Without talking.

[INHALES]

[EXHALES]

Good. Keep going.

[INHALES]

[EXHALES]

[INHALES]

[EXHALES]

JEONG JEONG: What are you doing here?

I did not tell you to stop!

I've been breathing for hours.

You want to stop breathing?

I want you to stop wasting my time.

I already know
how to squat and breathe

and feel the sun.

I want to know how to shoot fire
out of my fingertips.

[SIGHS]

I had a pupil once

who had no interest
in learning discipline.

He was only concerned
with the power of fire...

How he could use it
to destroy his opponents

and wipe out the obstacles
in his path,

but fire is a horrible burden to bear.

Its nature is to consume,

and without control,
it destroys everything around it.

[GRUNTS]

JEONG JEONG: Learn restraint,

or risk destroying yourself
and everything you love.

I thought about what you said.

I promise I'll be more patient.

We're going to work with fire now.

Oh, yeah!

I mean...

Let us begin.

Concentrate on the fire.

I want you to keep this flame
from reaching the edges of the leaf

for as long as you can.

[GROANS]

GUARD: Master, there is trouble!

What's going on?!

Concentrate on your leaf.

This is the worst
firebending instruction ever.

All he does
is leave me alone for hours

to concentrate or breathe.

I'm sure there's a good reason.

But I'm ready to do so much more.

[EXHALES]

[INHALES]

[EXHALES]

I did it. I made fire!

Aang, that's great.

But you should take it slow.

-Whoa!
-Careful!

Aagh!

Now, that's firebending.

Aang, you'll hurt yourself.

I wonder how that juggler did it.

[SCREAMS]

Katara!

I'm so sorry!

[WEEPING]

Katara, what's wrong?

What did you do?

It was an accident!

I was... Uh! Katara, I'm so...

[GRUNTS]

I told you we shouldn't
mess around with this!

Look what you did!

You burned my sister!

[SOBBING]

You burned my sister!

This is all your fault!

I know! Now, pack your things.

You must leave immediately.

I'm sorry.

I didn't...

I'm sorry!

[WEEPING]

[GRUNTING]

JEONG JEONG:
You have healing abilities.

The great benders of the Water Tribes
sometimes have this ability.

I've always wished
I were blessed like you...

Free from this burning curse.

But you're a great master.

You have powers I'll never know.

Water brings healing and life.

But fire brings only destruction
and pain.

It forces those of us
burdened with its care

to walk a razor's edge
between humanity and savagery.

Eventually we're torn apart.

Go get your friends and flee!

Do not come back here
or you will all be destroyed!

Hurry!

Don't worry, men.

My old teacher gave up fighting
a long time ago...

Haven't you, Master Jeong Jeong?

Katara, are you all right?

I'm fine.

We've gotta get out of here.

Where's Aang?

Jeong Jeong tried to tell me
that I wasn't ready.

I wouldn't listen.

I'm never gonna firebend again.

KATARA: You'll have to eventually.

No, never again.

It's OK, Aang. I'm healed.

What? How?

I'll explain later.

But, right now,
we have to get out of here.

Zhao and his soldiers are attacking.

Where?

By the river.

They captured Jeong Jeong.

I have to help him!

ZHAO: Look at you.

You were once so great.

I can't believe my former master

has become nothing more
than a simple savage.

It is you who have embraced
savagery, Zhao.

It's Admiral Zhao now.

That title will not help you
against the Avatar.

Do not try to fight him.

You are no match.

I think I can handle a child.

I have never seen such raw power.

[GROWLS]

AANG: Jeong Jeong!

We'll see.

Men, take The Deserter.

ZHAO: It's a trick!

He's run off into the woods.

Find him!

Let's find out what my old master
has taught you.

You were Jeong Jeong's student?

Until I got bored.

[GRUNTING]

[GASPS]

I see he taught you
how to duck and run like a coward,

but I doubt he showed you
what a firebender is truly capable of!

[GROWLS]

Whoa! Wild shot!

I'll show you wild! [GRUNTS]

No self-control.

ZHAO: Stand and fight, Avatar!

Oh, were we fighting?

I thought you were
just getting warmed up.

I was.

Is that all you got?

Man, they'll make anyone
an admiral these days.

[GROWLING]

Ahoy!

I'm Admiral Zhao.

[GROWLS]

I don't know why, but I thought
you'd be better than Zuko.

Aagh!

Sloppy.

-Very sloppy.
-[GRUNTS]

Nowhere to run now,

you little smart mouth.

You've lost this battle.

Are you crazy?

You haven't thrown a single blow.

No, but you have.

Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint.

[SCREAMS]

Have a nice walk home!

SOKKA: Aang, come on!

Let's go!

Wait! Where's Jeong Jeong?

He disappeared.

They all did.

Hey, where'd everybody go?

Very funny, guys!

[LOWING]

Aang, you're burned.

Let me help you.

[INHALES]

[EXHALES]

Wow! That's good water.

When did you learn how to do that?

I guess I always knew.

Oh. Well, then,

thanks for all the first aid
over the years...

Like, when I fell into
the greaseberry bramble,

and that time I had two fishhooks
in my thumb!

Two?

He tried to get the first fishhook out
with another fishhook.

SOKKA: Oh, and the time
that mink snake bit me.

Thanks for healing that up.

That's great. Really helpful.

So, travelers,
the next time you think you hear

a strange large bird talking,

take a closer look. It might not be
a giant parrot, but a flying man,

a member of a secret group
of airwalkers who laugh at gravity

and laugh at those
bound to the earth by it.

[MOMO COOING]

Aren't airbender stories the best?

Was it realistic?
Is that how it was back then?

I laugh at gravity all the time.

Ha ha! Gravity.

Jingle, jingle.

Sorry.

Aw. Cheapskates.


 


Hey, thanks for the story.

Tell it to the cap, boy.

Aw. Much obliged, little bat thing.

It means a lot
to hear airbender stories.

It must have been a hundred years ago

your great-grandpa met them.

What are you prattling about, child?

Great-grandpappy
saw the airwalkers last week.

[GREAT-GRANDPA SPEAKS HOARSELY]

AANG: We're almost
to the Northern Air Temple.

This is where
they had the championships

for sky bison polo.

Do you think
we'll really find airbenders?

You want me to be like you
or totally honest?

Are you saying I'm a liar?

I'm saying you're an optimist.
Same thing, basically.

Hey, guys, look at this!

They really are airbenders!

No, they're not.

What do you mean, they're not?

Those guys are flying!

Gliding maybe, but not flying.

You can tell by the way they move

they're not airbending.
Those people have no spirit.

Oh! Oh!

[BOY CHUCKLING]

I don't know, Aang.
That kid seemed pretty spirited.

Ow!

We'd better find some solid ground
before it finds us.

Ha ha!

Go, Teo!

Show that bald kid how it's done!

Hey there. You're pretty good.

Yeah, I know.
But I can do more than fancy gliding.

Wow! I don't think I can do that.

But here's a good one.

[KIDS CHEERING]

What do you think?

It's great.

Hey, you're a real airbender.

You must be the Avatar.

That's amazing!
I've heard stories about you.

Thanks.

Wow! This glider chair is incredible.

If you think this is good,
wait until you see

the other stuff my dad designed.

Wow!

Yeah, my dad is the mastermind

behind this whole place.

Everything is powered by hot air.

It even pumps hot air currents outside

to give us a lift when we're gliding.

This place is unbelievable.

Yeah. It's great, isn't it?

No. Just unbelievable.

Aang used to come here
a long time ago.

I think he's a little shocked
it's so different.

So better!

This is supposed to be
the history of my people.

Ugh!

I'm sure some parts of the temple
are still the same.

AANG: It's nice to see at least
one part of the temple

that isn't ruined.

[MAN YELLS]

[ALL COUGHING]

What the doodle? Don't you know enough

to stay away from construction sites?

We have to make room
for the bathhouse.

Do you know what you did?

You just destroyed something sacred

for a stupid bathhouse.

Well, people around here
are starting to stink.

This whole place stinks.

Hyah!

This is a sacred temple.
You can't treat it this way.

I've seen it when the monks were here.

I know what it's supposed to be like.

The monks? But you're 12.

Dad, he's the Avatar.

He used to come here
a hundred years ago.

What are you doing?
Who said you could be here?

Doing here...

A long time ago,
but not a hundred years,

my people became refugees

after a terrible flood.

My infant son, Teo, was badly hurt

and lost his mother.

[SNIFFLES]

I needed somewhere to rebuild,

and I stumbled across this place.

Couldn't believe it.

Everywhere pictures of flying people,
but empty.

Nobody home.

Then I came across
these fan-like contraptions.

Our gliders.

Yes, little light flying machines.

They gave me an idea...

Build a new life for my son
in the air.

Then everyone would be
on equal ground,

so to speak.

We're just in the process of
improving upon what's already here.

And after all,
isn't that what nature does?

Nature knows where to stop.

I suppose that's true.

Unfortunately, progress has a way
of getting away from us.

Look at the time!

Come. The pulley system
must be oiled before dark.

Wait. How can you tell the time
from that thing?

The notches all look the same.

The candle will tell us. Watch.

You put spark powder in the candle!

Four flashes. So it's exactly
four hours past midday,

or as I call it, four o'candle.

Ha ha!

If you liked that,

wait till you see
my finger-safe knife sharpener.

It only took me three tries
to get it right.

Aah!

Follow me.

Hey, Aang,
I want to show you something.

AANG: I just can't get over it.

There's not a single thing
that's the same.

I don't know about that.

The temple might be different,

but the creatures that live here are
probably direct descendants

of the ones that lived here
a long time ago.

You're right. They're kind of keepers
of the temple's origins.

Besides, there is
one part of the temple

that hasn't changed at all.

KATARA: Hey...

It's just like the one
in the other air temple.

Only an airbender can open it.

So inside, it's completely untouched.

Just the way the monks left it.

I've always wondered
what it was like in there.

Aang?

I'm sorry.
This is the last part of the temple

that's the same as it was.

I want it to stay that way.

I completely understand.

I just wanted you to know it was here.

Thanks.

These lanterns are terrible.
I can't see.

Why would you
want to use fireflies for light?

Hey! Close that up. They'll get loose.

Fireflies are
a nonflammable light source.

Cover your nose and hold your breath.

OK. So you brought me
all the way down here

to see an empty room.

Wrong.

It's filled to the brim
with natural gas.

I came across it my first time here.

Unfortunately, I was
carrying a torch at the time.

Nearly blew myself and the whole place
even more sky-high.

I thought my eyebrows
would never grow back.

Anyway, there's a vital problem
that needs solving.

From time to time, we have gas leaks.

And they're nearly impossible to find.

So this place is an explosion
waiting to happen.

Yes. Until I figure out how to locate

something I can't see,
hear, smell, or touch.

TEO: The wind will carry you.

It supports something inside you,

something even lighter than air.

And that something
takes over when you fly.

I've changed my mind.

I think I was born
without that something.

Ha! Impossible. Everybody has it.

AANG: Spirit.

What?

That's the something
you're talking about.

Yeah. I suppose it is.

Are you ready?

No! Aah!

[LAUGHING]

I can't believe I'm flying!

Just make sure
you keep your mouth closed

so you don't swallow a bug.

Teo was right about the air.

All I had to do was trust it,

let it carry me.

Even though Teo's not an airbender,

he really does have the spirit of one.

I've been thinking.

If you want to see
what's in that room,

I'd be happy to open the door for you.

-Great.
-KATARA: Wait!

How do I land this thing?

What if I land over in the...

[GAGS]

Blech! Bug. bug.

That was a bug.

[CRASH]

I said, don't touch anything.

Oh!

Oh, don't worry.

That experiment is old,

and that egg was just
part of last week's lunch.

[SNIFFS] Ugh!

Week-old egg smell.

Quick, find that egg.

I can't believe I'm finally
going to see what's inside.

How could something that's so small,
you can't even see it,

make such a big stink?

That's the solution to our problem.

Yeah. If we put a whole mess
of rotten eggs

in the cellar
where the gas seeps up...

The gas will mix
with the smell of rotten eggs.

Then if there's a leak...

You smell rotten eggs.

Then you just follow your nose

to the place where the smell
is coming from...

And plug up the hole
where the gas is escaping.

-You're a genius!
-You're a genius!

[BELL RINGING]

Something is wrong. I've got to go.

This is a nightmare.

You don't understand.

You're making weapons
for the Fire Nation.

You make weapons for the Fire Nation?

Explain all this... Now!

It was about a year
after we moved here.

Fire Nation soldiers
found our settlement.

You were too young
to remember this tale.

They were going to destroy everything,

burn it to the ground.

I pleaded with them.
I begged them to spare us.

They asked what I had to offer.

I offered my services.

You must understand.
I did this for you.

[DOOR OPENS]

When are they coming?

Soon, very soon.

You can't give them more weapons.

If I don't give them what they want,

they will destroy this place.

How can I be proud of you

when your inventions
are being used for murder?

I need some time to think.

[BELL RINGING]

You need to leave. Go.

We're not leaving.

Then hide quickly.

You know better
than to keep me waiting.

Give me what you owe us
so I can be on my way.

Well? Is there a problem?

No. Right this way.

The deal is off.

The Avatar.

Aang, don't get involved.

If I don't get what I came for,

the Fire Nation
will burn this place to rubble.

Get out of here.

Uh!

You're leaving empty-handed.

Then the destruction of this temple
will be on your head.

This is bad, very bad.

Aang, what are we gonna do?

How can we possibly
keep them all away?

I'll tell you how.

We have something they don't...

Air power.

We control the sky.

That's something
the Fire Nation can't do.

We can win.

DAD: I want to help.

Good. We'll need it.

We finally got
the war balloon working,

thanks to Sokka.

This boy is a genius.

Thank you. You're a genius.

Thank you.

See, the problem
with the old war balloon was,

you could get it airborne,

but once you did, it just kept going.

You could put a hole in the top,

but then all the hot air would escape.

So the question became,
how do you keep a lid on hot air?

Ugh. If only we knew.

[LAUGHTER]

A lid is actually the answer.

If you control the hot air,
you control the war balloon.

Hmm, that's actually pretty smart.

OK. We got four kinds of bombs...

Smoke, slime, fire, and...

Stink.

Never underestimate
the power of stink.

They're coming!

Are we ready?

Yes, but where's Sokka
with the war balloon?

We'll have to start without it.

[CHEERING]

-Uhh!
-Uh!

Ooh!

Take them out of the sky now!

[ALL COUGHING]

We've got them on the run.

We need more slime.

Aah!

Huh!

Uhh... Uh!

Whoa!

Uh! Huh!

Uh! Huh! Yaah!

Those things are unstoppable.

I think I know how they work.

I remember my dad tinkering with
a counterbalancing system,

something to do with water.

Works great, huh?

Water? Can you get me close to one?

No problem.

Huh!

Huh!

[ROAR]

We're out of bombs.

Come on, Sokka.
Where's that war balloon?

Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?

The insignia.

They think we're on their side.

Then I guess
they won't see this coming.

Bombs away.

Uh! Hey! Aah!

Oh, no. That was the last one.

Wait a second. [SNIFFS]

You smell that?

Rotten eggs. There.

That's where the gas is escaping.

What are you doing?
That's our fuel source.

It's the only bomb we've got.

AANG: Look. They're retreating.

Yeah!

SOKKA: We're going down!

No! Sokka, hold on!

Get ready.

Oh!

AANG: You know what?

I'm really glad
you guys all live here now.

I realized it's like the hermit crab.

Maybe you weren't born here,

but you found this empty shell
and made it your home,

and now you protect each other.

That means a lot coming from you.

Aang, you were right about air power.

As long as we've got the skies,

we'll have the Fire Nation on the run.

[CHEERING]

This defeat is the gateway
to many victories.

I'm not one to complain,

but can't Appa fly any higher?

I have an idea.

Why don't we all get on your back,

and you can fly us to the North Pole.

I'd love to.

Climb on, everyone.

Sokka is ready for takeoff.

Look, we're all just a little tired
and cranky

because we've been flying
for two days straight.

And for what?


 


We can't even find
the Northern Water Tribe.

There's nothing up here.

[SPLASH]

Aagh!

[KIDS SCREAMING]

They're water benders.

We found the Water Tribe.

ZHAO: He's heading north.

The Northern Water Tribe.

The Avatar
needs to master waterbending.

He is looking for a teacher.

Then what are we waiting for?
Let's go get him.

Patience, Captain Li.

This isn't some little earth village

we can just march into.

The Water Tribe is a great nation.

There's a reason they've survived
100 years of war.

The frozen tundra is treacherous.

The landscape itself
is an icy fortress.

We'll need a massive invasion force.

There it is!

KATARA: The Northern Water Tribe.

We're finally here.

[MOMO COOS]

KATARA: I can't believe
how many waterbenders live up here.

We'll find a master
to teach us no problem.

KATARA: This place is beautiful.

Yeah.

She is.

[DRUMS BEATING]

[SCREAMS]

Tonight, we celebrate the arrival

of our brother and sister

from the Southern Tribe.

And they have brought with them
someone very special,

someone who many of us believed

disappeared from the world
until now...

The Avatar.

[CHEERING]

We also celebrate
my daughter's 16th birthday.

Princess Yue is now of marrying age.

Thank you, Father.

May the great Ocean and Moon Spirits

watch over us
during these troubled times.

Now, Master Pakku
and his students will perform!

[APPLAUSE]

Hi there. Sokka, Southern Water Tribe.

Very nice to meet you.

So, uh...

You're a princess, huh?

You know, back in my tribe,
I'm kind of like a prince myself.

Ha! The prince of what?

A lot of things!

Do you mind? I'm trying
to have a conversation here.

My apologies, Prince Sokka.

So, it looks like
I'm gonna be in town for a while.

I'm thinking maybe we could...

Do an activity together?

Do an activity?

[COUGHS]

Very smooth.

Master Pakku,

meet your newest student:

the Avatar.

Just because
you're destined to save the world,

don't expect any special treatment.

My friend and I can't wait
to start training with you...

After we relax for a couple of days.

If you want to relax,

then I suggest
visiting a tropical island.

If not, I'll see you both at sunrise.

Good night.

For the last time,
I'm not playing the sungi horn.

No, it's about our plans.

There is a bit of a problem.

I'm taking your crew.

What?

I've recruited them
for a little expedition

to the North Pole.

Uncle, is that true?

I'm afraid so.

He's taking everyone...

Even the cook.

Sorry you won't be there

to watch me capture the Avatar,

but I can't have you
getting in my way again.

-[GROWLS]
-No!

I didn't know you were skilled
with broadswords, Prince Zuko.

I'm not.

They're antiques.

Just decorative.

Have you heard of the Blue Spirit,
General Iroh?

Just rumors.

I don't think he is real.

He's real, all right.

He's a criminal

and an enemy of the Fire Nation.

But I have a feeling justice
will catch up with him soon.

General Iroh, the offer
to join my mission still stands...

If you change your mind.

I've waited for this day
my whole life.

I finally get to learn from
a real waterbending master!

Good morning, Master Pakku!

No, please! March right in!

I'm not concentrating or anything.

Uh, this is my friend... Katara...

The one I told you about.

I'm sorry.

I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

You didn't tell me
your friend was a girl.

In our tribe, it is forbidden

for women to learn waterbending.

What do you mean, you won't teach me?

I didn't travel
across the entire world

so you could tell me no!

No.

But there must be
other female waterbenders

in your tribe.

Here, the women learn from Yagoda

to use their waterbending to heal.

I'm sure she would be
happy to take you

as her student...

Despite your bad attitude.

I don't want to heal. I want to fight!

I can see that.

But our tribe has customs, rules.

Well, your rules stink!

Yeah!

They're not fair.

If you won't teach Katara, then...

Then what?

Then I won't learn from you!

Well, have fun teaching yourself.

I'm sure you'll do a great job.

Wait!

Aang didn't mean that.

You can't risk your training for me.

You have to learn from Master Pakku,

even if he is a big jerk.

Why don't we get started, then.

SOKKA: Princess Yue, good morning!

[PANTING]

Hey, how about that picnic last night?

Boy, your dad sure knows
how to throw a party.

I'm happy you enjoyed yourself.

Well, it wasn't as much fun
after you left.

So, I'm still hoping
we can see more of each other.

Do an activity, you mean?

Yes, at a place...

For some time.

I'd love to.

I'll meet you on that bridge tonight.

Great! I'll see you...

Aagh!

[GIGGLES] Sorry.

That's OK. It was worth it.

See you tonight.

ZHAO: I'm very impressed.

You all seem highly qualified

for the mission I have in mind.

[SQUAWKING]

That's some tasty gold.

What do you need us to do?

I believe you're acquainted
with Prince Zuko.

Um, hi.

Are you Yagoda?

Are you here for the healing lesson?

I guess I am.

Welcome!

Welcome!

You're moving the water around,

but you're not feeling
the push and pull.

I'm trying.

[SLURP]

Ahh!

Maybe that move
is too advanced for you.

Why don't you try an easier one?

[GROWLS]

Thanks for the lesson.

So, who's the lucky boy?

Huh?

Your betrothal necklace.

You're getting married, right?

Oh, no.

I don't think I'm ready for that yet.

My grandmother
gave my mother this necklace,

and my mother passed it down to me.

I recognize this carving!

I don't know
why I didn't realize sooner.

You're the spitting image of Kanna.

Wait!

How do you know my gran-gran's name?

When I was about your age,

I was friends with Kanna.

She was born here...

In the Northern Tribe.

She never told me.

Your grandmother
had an arranged marriage

with a young waterbender.

He carved that necklace for her.

If gran-gran was engaged,
why did she leave?

I don't know.

That's always been a mystery to me.

She left without saying good-bye.

IROH: Good luck!

The crew wanted me
to wish you safe travels.

Good riddance to those traitors.

It's a lovely night for a walk.

Why don't you join me?

It would clear your head.

Or just stay in your room

and sit in the dark.

Whatever makes you happy.

[DOOR CLOSES]

[HUMMING]

Whoa!

Careful with the blasting jelly.

-[SQUEAK]
-Ooh!

Uncle?

Uncle, is that you?

[SQUAWK]

Aah!

[ZUKO SCREAMING]

Zuko!

Zuko.

Hi, Princess Yue.

I made you something.

I carved it myself.

It's a bear.

Actually, it's supposed to be a fish.

See, it has a fin.

Oh.

I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

I shouldn't have
asked you to come here.

[GRUNTS]

KATARA: How's warrior training going?

[GROWLS]

That bad?

No, it's Princess Yue.

I don't get it.

One minute,
she wants to go out with me,

and the next,
she's telling me to get lost.

So, how's waterbending training?

Master Poop-head won't teach her
because she's a girl.

Why don't you just teach her, Aang?

Why didn't I think of that?

At night, you can teach me

whatever moves
you learn from Master Pakku.

That way,
you have someone to practice with,

and I get to learn waterbending.

Everyone's happy!

I'm not happy.

But you're never happy.

Come on, Aang.

Master Pakku said this move

is all about sinking and floating.

I got it!

That was amazing!

That wasn't me.

I was just showing Katara a few moves.

You have disrespected me,

my teachings, and my entire culture.

I'm sorry, I...

You are no longer welcome
as my student.

What do you want me to do?

Force Master Pakku to take Aang back

as his student?

Yes. Please.

I suspect he might change his mind

if you swallow your pride
and apologize to him.

Fine.

I'm waiting, little girl.

No!

No way am I apologizing
to a sour old man like you!

AANG: Uh, Katara...

I'll be outside
if you're man enough to fight me.

I'm sure she didn't mean that.

Yeah, I think she did.

I'm devastated
to hear about Prince Zuko.

Just devastated.

The Fire Lord will not be pleased

when he learns who was responsible.

You know who was behind the attack?

Yes. Pirates.

We had a run-in with them
a while back.

They wanted revenge.

So, have you reconsidered my offer?

Yes, I accept.

It will be an honor
to serve as your general.

To the Fire Nation.

To victory!

SOKKA: Are you crazy, Katara?

You're not gonna win this fight.

I know. I don't care.

You don't have to do this for me.

I can find another teacher.

I'm not doing it for you.

Someone needs to
slap some sense into that guy.

So, you decided to show up?

Aren't you gonna fight?

Go back to the healing huts

with the other women,
where you belong.

Fine.

You want to learn to fight so bad,

study closely.

Don't worry.
I'm not going to hurt you.

Ow!

You can't knock me down!

AANG: Go, Katara!

[CHEERING]

[CHEERING]

[PANTING]

Well, I'm impressed.

You are an excellent waterbender.

But you still won't teach me,
will you?

No.

[PANTING]

This fight is over.

Come back here. I'm not finished yet.

Yes. You are.

This is my necklace.

No, it's not. It's mine. Give it back!

I made this 60 years ago...

For the love of my life...

For Kanna.

My gran-gran
was supposed to marry you?

Our plan is working perfectly.

Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.

You didn't have to do this.

No nephew of mine
is going to stow away on a ship

without some backup.

Thank you, Uncle.

[DOOR OPENS]

Someone's coming.

Stay hidden
until we get to the North Pole

and the Avatar will be yours.

Good luck.

I carved this necklace
for your grandmother

when we got engaged.

I thought we would have
a long happy life together.

I loved her.

But she didn't love you, did she?

It was an arranged marriage.

Gran-gran wouldn't let your tribe's
stupid customs run her life.

That's why she left.

It must have taken a lot of courage.

[SOBBING]

Go get her.

What do you want from me?

Nothing.

I just want you to know
I think you're beautiful.

And I never thought a girl like you
would even notice a guy like me.

You don't understand.

No, no.

See, that's the thing.

I think I do understand now.

You're a princess, and I'm...

I'm just a southern peasant.

No, Sokka.

It's OK.

You don't have to say anything.

I'll see you around, OK.

OK, now I'm really confused!

Happy, but confused.

I do like you... A lot!

But we can't be together.

And not for the reason you think.

It's because...

I'm engaged.

I'm sorry.

Not bad. Not bad.

Ha ha ha ha.

Keep practicing,
and maybe you'll get it

by the time you're my age.

[PANTING]

Hey, Katara.

What do you think you're doing?

It's past sunrise.

You're late.

Good to see you here.

You, too.

My fleet is ready.

Set a course
for the Northern Water Tribe.

Nice try, Pupil Sangok.

A couple of more years,

and you might be ready
to fight a sea sponge.

Whoa!

Would anyone care for
a rematch with Katara?

[GROANING]

Katara, you've
advanced more quickly

than any student I've ever trained.

You have proven
that with fierce determination,

passion, and hard work,

you can accomplish anything.

Raw talent alone is not enough.

Pupil Aang!


 


Yes, Master Pakku?

Care to step into
the sparring circle?

I figure since you've found time
to play with house pets,

you must have
already mastered waterbending.

I wouldn't say mastered,

but check this out!

YUE: So, they don't have palaces
in the Southern Tribe?

Are you kidding?

I grew up in a block of ice.

It's not exactly a cultural hub.

[GIGGLES]

Sokka, this is wrong.

What's wrong?

We're taking a walk!

I'm engaged.

It just feels...

I know what you need.

You need to meet my good friend Appa.

Who?

[GROWLING]

Appa and I go way back,
don't we, boy?

Aagh! Easy!

Down, boy!

No, up!

YUE: Looks like you haven't been
giving Appa enough attention.

[CHUCKLES]

So, how does this work?

You hanging on tight?

Mm-hmm.

Yip, yip.

Oh, my goodness!

Wow!

I can't believe you do this every day.

Yeah, we pretty much live up here.

Is it always this cold in the sky?

Not when you're with someone.

It's beautiful up here.

Yeah.

Whoo, yeah!

[INHALES DEEPLY]

Good times, good times.

Hey, look.

YUE: What's happening?

[GROWLS]

Oh, no.

[LAUGHING]

[COUGHS]

SOKKA: Soot.
YUE: What?

I've seen it before.

Right before my village was attacked.

It's soot mixed with snow.

But why?

It's the Fire Nation.

They've closed in on the North Pole.

And from the looks of this stuff,

I'd say there's a lot of them.

ZHAO: This will truly be one for
the history books, General Iroh.

Just think. Centuries from now,

people will study
the Great Admiral Zhao,

who destroyed the last

of the Water Tribe civilization.

You're lucky you're here to see it.

Be careful what you wish for, Admiral.

History is not always kind
to its subjects.

I suppose you speak from experience.

But, rest assured,
this will be nothing like

your legendary failure at Ba Sing Se.

I hope not, for your sake.

Tell the captains to prepare
for first strike.

We'll be landing soon.

Do you have a plan?

I'm working on it, Uncle.

[DRUM POUNDING]

What's wrong? We have to go!

No, Sokka.

Wait.

I can't see you anymore.

Not at all.

What? We're just friends.

I wish we could just be friends.

But I like you too much,

and it's too confusing
to be around you.

I'm marrying someone else.

You don't love him, do you?

You don't even seem to like him.

But I do love my people.

You're not marrying them!

You don't understand.

I have duties to my father,

to my tribe.

I have to do this.

Good-bye.

The day we have feared
for so long has arrived.

The Fire Nation is on our doorstep.

It is with great sadness

I call my family here before me,

knowing well that some of these faces

are about to vanish from our tribe.

But they will never vanish
from our hearts.

Now, as we approach
the battle for our existence,

I call upon the great spirits.

Spirit of the ocean,

spirit of the moon, be with us!

I'm going to need volunteers
for a dangerous mission.

-Count me in.
-Sokka...

Be warned.

Many of you will not return.

Come forward to receive my mark

if you accept the task.

The stillness before battle
is unbearable.

Such a quiet dread.

I wasn't there when the Fire Nation
attacked my people.

I'm gonna make a difference this time.

[SCREAMING]

[SNARLS]

Yip, yip!

Katara!

[YELLS]

[GRUNTS]

I'll take it from here, boy.

Appa!

Thanks for the rescue, buddy.

You've gotta be kidding me.

Men, you'll be infiltrating
the Fire Nation navy.

That means you'll all need
one of these uniforms.

[LAUGHTER]

What's your problem?

Fire navy uniforms
don't look like that.

Of course they do.

These are real uniforms captured
from actual fire navy soldiers.

When, like, 100 years ago?

85.

The Fire Nation doesn't wear
shoulder spikes anymore.

The newer uniforms
are more streamlined.

How do we know we can trust this guy?

Such bold talk for a new recruit.

Sokka is from our sister tribe, Hahn.

He is a capable warrior,
and I value his input.

Now, our first objective
is to determine

the identity
of their commanding officer.

His name is Zhao.

Middle-aged, big sideburns,
bigger temper...

Sokka, I want you to tell
everything you know to Hahn.

He's leading this mission.

Hahn, show Sokka your respect.

I expect nothing less
from my future son-in-law.

Princess Yue's marrying you?

Yeah. What of it?

Nothing. Congratulations.

Stop those fireballs!

IROH: It's almost twilight, Admiral.

As your military consultant,

I must advise you to halt your attack.

The waterbenders draw their power
from the moon,

and it is nearly full tonight.

You should wait
and resume the attack at daybreak.

ZHAO: Oh, I am well aware
of the moon problem.

And I'm working on a solution.

But for now, daybreak it is.

YUE: They've stopped firing.

Aang!

I can't do it.

I can't do it.

KATARA: What happened?

I must have taken out
a dozen fire navy ships,

but there's just too many of them.

I can't fight them all!

But you have to.

You're the Avatar.

I'm just one kid.

If you are fishing
for an octopus, my nephew,

you need a tightly woven net,

or he will squeeze through
the tiniest hole and escape.

I don't need your wisdom
right now, Uncle.

I'm sorry, I just nag you because...

Well, ever since I lost my son...

Uncle, you don't have to say it.

I think of you as my own.

I know, Uncle.

We'll meet again.

After I have the Avatar.

Remember your breath of fire.

It could save your life out there.

I will.

And put your hood up.

Keep your ears warm.

I'll be fine!

Let me tell you, Sokka,

I've courted a lot of girls,
but Yue is the finest.

And she comes with the most perks.

Perks?! What does that mean?

I mean,
Yue's nice and everything,

but the points I'll gain
with the chief aren't bad either.

Princess Yue is wasted
on a self-absorbed weasel like you!

Whoa, hang on!

What do you care?

You're just a simple rube
from the Southern Tribe.

What would you know of the political
complexities of our life?

No offense.

[SCREAMS]

You're just a jerk without a soul!
No offense!

That's enough!

Sokka, you're off the mission.

All right, fall in, men!

Everybody listen to what I say,

and we'll take out this Admiral Cho
in no time!

It's Admiral Zhao!

[ANIMALS CALLING]

Where are they going?

They're coming up for air somewhere.

[INHALES DEEPLY]

YUE: The legends say the moon
was the first waterbender.

Our ancestors saw how it pushed
and pulled the tides,

and learned how to do it themselves.

KATARA: I've always noticed
my waterbending is stronger at night.

Our strength comes from
the spirit of the moon,

our life comes from the spirit
of the ocean.

They work together to keep balance.

The spirits.

Maybe I can find them
and get their help.

How can you do that?

The avatar is the bridge

between our world
and the spirit world.

Aang can talk to them!

Maybe they'll give you the wisdom
to win this battle.

Or maybe they'll unleash

a crazy-amazing spirit attack
on the Fire Nation!

Or wisdom. That's good, too.

The only problem is,

the last time you got
to the spirit world by accident.

How are you going
to get there this time?

I have an idea. Follow me.

So, is this the way
to the spirit world?

Ha ha ha. No.

You'll have to get there on your own.
But I can take you

to the most spiritual place
in the entire North Pole.

[GASPS]

I never thought
I'd miss grass this much!

It's so warm here!
How is that possible?

It's the center
of all spiritual energy in our land.

You're right, Yue.

I can feel...

Something.

It's so...

Tranquil.

[ANIMALS CALLING]

[SHUDDERING]

Be quiet!

[LOWING STOPS]

[LOWING]

CHIEF: Is something wrong, Sokka?

Oh, no.

Hahn's out there
on the top-secret mission,

while I'm here
sharpening my boomerang.

Everything's fine.

Listen to me.

I took you off the mission
for selfish reasons.

I have a special task in mind for you.

What, you want me
to scrub the barracks?

I want you to guard my daughter,
Princess Yue.

Oh. Sure.

That shouldn't be too hard.

[GASPING]

[GASPING]

YUE: [WHISPERING]
Why is he sitting like that?

He's meditating.

Trying to cross over
into the spirit world.

It takes all his concentration.

Is there any way we can help?

AANG: How about some quiet?!

Come on, guys,
I can hear every word you're saying.

Is he OK?

He's crossing into the spirit world.

He'll be fine as long as
we don't move his body.

That's his way back
to the physical world.

Maybe we should get some help?

No. He's my friend.

I'm perfectly capable
of protecting him.

ZUKO: Well, aren't you a big girl now?

No...

Yes.

Hand him over
and I won't have to hurt you.

Hyah!

I see you've learned a new trick.

But I didn't come this far
to lose to you.

You little peasant.

You've found a master, haven't you?

Hyah!

Hyah! Hyah...

Aah! Uh!

Hyah! Hyah...

It's daybreak at last.

Let's write history.

You rise with the moon,
I rise with the sun.

[ALL YELLING]

The Water Tribe can try
to resist the inevitable,

but their city will fall today.

[GASPS]

Aang?!

What happened?! Where's Zuko?!

He took Aang.

He took him right out from under me.

Where did they go?

I can't believe I lost him.

You did everything you could...

and now we need to do everything
we can to get him back.

Zuko can't have gotten far. We'll find him.
Aang's gonna be fine.

Okay.

It's all right. You stay here,
Momo, in case Aang comes back.

Yip! Yip!

Hello? I'm sorry
to disturb you...

but I just really need to find
the Moon and the Ocean spirits.

Go... away.


 


You're still here?

Yes! I need...

Perhaps that thing will help you?
Chase it!

Finally!

Come back!

Hello, Aang.

Roku!

Shelter!

Roku, the Water Tribe is under attack. I
need to find the Ocean and Moon spirits!

The Ocean and the Moon
are ancient spirits.

They crossed over from the Spirit World to
the Mortal World very near the beginning.

There is only one spirit I know
of who is old enough to remember.

Who?

The spirit's name is Koh. But he is very
dangerous. They call him... the Face Stealer.

When you speak with him you must be very
careful to show no emotion at all...

not the slightest expression
or he will steal your face!

I finally have you. But I can't get
you home because of this blizzard.

There's always something. Not
that you would understand.

You're like my sister. Everything always...
came easy to her.

She's a firebending prodigy...
and everyone adores her.

My father says she was born lucky.
He says I was lucky to be born.

I don't need luck though,
I don't want it.

I've always had to struggle and
fight and that's made me strong.

It's made me who I am.

I don't need to remind you
we have a time limit.

If we don't defeat the Water Tribe before the
full moon rises they will be undefeatable.

I assure you I have
everything under control.

I intend to remove the
moon as a factor.

Remove the moon!? How?

Admiral Choi!

Prepare to meet your fate!

As I was saying... years ago I stumbled
upon a great and powerful secret...

the identity of the Moon
Spirit's mortal form.

What?

I was a young Lieutenant serving under
General Shu in the Earth Kingdom...

I discovered a hidden library, underground
in fact. I tore through scroll after scroll.

One of them contained a detailed illustration
and the words "moon" and "ocean."

I knew then that these spirits
could be found... and killed.

And that it was my
destiny to do so.

Zhao, the Spirits are
not to be trifled with!

Yes, yes, I know you
fear the Spirits, Iroh.

I've heard rumors about your
journey into the Spirit World.

But the Ocean and Moon gave up their
immortality to become a part of our world...

and now they will face
the consequences!

Oh! Whew! You're just a
curly tailed blue nose.

Show no fear. Show
no emotion at all.

Hello? I'm looking for
a spirit named "Koh."

Welcome!

Thank you.

My old friend, the Avatar.
It's been a long time.

You know me?

How could I forget you!

One of your previous
incarnations tried to slay me!

It was eight or nine
hundred years ago.

I didn't know that. Why did he...
or I... try to kill you?

Oh... it was something about stealing
the face of someone you loved...

Of course, that's all behind us.

Why should I hold a grudge against
you for something in a past life?

After all, you're a different person now.
You've come to me... with a new face.

Guess we'll be here awhile.

Don't worry! Prince Zuko can't be
getting too far in this weather.

I'm not worried they'll get away in the
blizzard. I'm worried that they won't.

They're not gonna die
in this blizzard.

If we know anything it's
that Zuko never gives up.

They'll survive...
and we'll find them!

It's been a long time since I've added
a child's face to my collection.

So... how may I help you?

I need to find the
Moon and the Ocean.

Their spirit names
are Tui and La.

Push... and Pull... and that has been the
nature of their relationship for all time.

Please, help me find them.

An entire culture could be destroyed
if I don't get their help.

Oh, you think you need their help?
Actually, it's quite the other way around.

Someone's going to kill them!

What do you mean? How can I
find them and protect them?

You've already met
them, actually.

Tui and La, your
Moon and Ocean...

have always circled each
other in an eternal dance.

They balance each other... push and pull...
life and death...

good and evil... yin...
and yang.

The koi fish!

I must be going now.

We'll meet again.

The spirits are in trouble. I need
to get back to the physical world.

A friend is here
to guide you back.

Hei-Bai!

We'll be following this map
to a very special location.

And when we get there...
we're going fishing.

This is where I came in.
But how do I get back?

Good riddance.

Momo!

Momo? Oh no! Where's my body?

Look! That's gotta be Aang!
Yip! Yip!

Welcome back.

Good to be back.

That won't be enough to escape.

Appa!

Here for a rematch?

Trust me, Zuko, it's not
going to be much of a match.

Hey! This is some quality rope!

We need to get to the oasis!
The spirits are in trouble!

Wait, we can't just
leave him here.

Sure we can. Let's go.

No, if we leave him, he'll die.

Yeh, this makes a lot of sense. Let's bring
the guy who's constantly trying to kill us!

Are you okay?

I feel faint.

I feel it too.

The Moon Spirit is in trouble.

I owe the Moon Spirit my life.

What do you mean?

When I was born I was
very sick and very weak.

Most babies cry when
they're born...

but I was born as if I were asleep.
My eyes closed.

Our healers did
everything they could.

They told my mother and
father I was going to die.

My father pleaded with the
spirits to save me...

that night, beneath
the full moon...

he brought me to the oasis
and placed me in the pond.

My dark hair turned white, I
opened my eyes and began to cry...

and they knew I would live.

That's why my mother named
me Yue, for the moon.

I am... a legend now! The Fire Nation will
for generations tell stories about...

the great Zhao who
darkened the moon!

They will call me Zhao the Conqueror! Zhao
the Moon Slayer! Zhao The Invincible!

Huh! Get it off! Get if off!

Don't bother!

Zhao! Don't!

It's my destiny... to destroy the Moon...
and the Water Tribe.

Destroying the moon won't
hurt just the Water Tribe.

It will hurt everyone...
including you.

Without the moon, everything
would fall out of balance.

You have no idea what kind of chaos
that would unleash on the world.

He is right, Zhao!

General Iroh, why am I not surprised
to discover your treachery?

I'm no traitor, Zhao, the Fire
Nation needs the moon too.

We all depend on the balance.

Whatever you do to that spirit I'll
unleash on you ten-fold! Let it go, now!

There's no hope now. It's over.

No, it's not over.

You're alive?

You tried to have me killed!

Yes, I did. You're the Blue Spirit...
and enemy of the Fire Nation!

You freed the Avatar!

I had no choice!

You should have chosen to accept
your failure... your disgrace!

Then, at least you
could have lived!

It's too late. It's dead.

You have been touched by the Moon Spirit.
Some of its life is in you!

Yes, you're right. It gave me life.
Maybe I can give it back.

No! You don't have to do that!

It's my duty, Sokka.

I won't let you! Your father
told me to protect you!

I have to do this.

No!

She's gone. She's gone.

Goodbye, Sokka. I will
always be with you.

It can't be!

Take my hand!

I've decided to go
to the South Pole.

Some other benders and
healers want to join me.

It's time we helped
rebuild our sister tribe.

What about Aang? He still
needs to learn waterbending.

Well, then he better get used
to calling you "Master Katara."

The Spirits gave me a
vision when Yue was born.

I saw... a beautiful, brave young woman...
become the Moon Spirit.

I knew this day would come.

You must be proud.

So proud. And sad.

I'm surprised, Prince Zuko...

surprised that you are not at this
moment trying to capture the Avatar.

I'm tired.

Then you should rest.
A man needs his rest.

You too, Momo.

Come here.

Iroh is a traitor and your brother Zuko
is a failure. I have a task for you.
