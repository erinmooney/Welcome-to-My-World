Long ago, Xadia was one land...

rich in magic and wonder.

In the old times, there were only
the six Primal Sources of magic...

The Sun. The Moon.

The Stars.

The Earth.

The Sky.

And the Ocean.

But a thousand years ago,
a human mage discovered new magic...

the seventh source.

Dark Magic.

It used the essence
within magical creatures themselves

to unleash dark power.

Horrified by what they saw,

the elves and the dragons
put a stop to the madness.

They drove every last human to the west.

And so, the continent
was divided in two.

In the east, the magical lands of Xadia.

And in the west, the human kingdoms.

For centuries, the King of the Dragons
himself defended the border.

- Forward!
- Forward!

The humans called him Thunder,
for when he spoke,

his voice shook the Earth and the sky.

But on the eve of last Winter's Turn,


 


the humans used unspeakable Dark Magic
to slay Thunder.

Then, without mercy,
they destroyed his only egg, his heir...

the Dragon Prince.

Now the world stands on the edge
of all-out war.

Take that, marshmallow monster.

Callum!

It's okay, Ezran.

It's just a thunderstorm.
Nothing to be afraid of.

Go back to sleep.

I wasn't scared...

Bait was scared.

Who's there?

Declare yourself,
in the name of King Harrow!

Please!

Who are you?

High Mage! Please, it's urgent!

Lord Viren! I've seen something.

Lord Viren, uh...
King Harrow hasn't risen yet.

Viren, didn't I tell you if you ever
woke me up this early again...

I'd have you executed?

I'll give you a moment.

So, what's so important that you come into
my bedroom risking your life like this?

Assassins.

I see.

A scout on patrol discovered them
just before dawn.

Well, don't look so grim.
We've fought off plenty of assassins.

Haven't we, Pip?

It's different this time.

We believe they're Moonshadow elves.

Moonshadow elves?
Then how did the scout escape?

I don't know. It was muddy, wet, dark...

Somehow he got very lucky.

The Crown Guard won't be enough
to hold them off.

Send for General Amaya
and the Standing Battalion.

The Breach is too far.
They'll never make it back in time.

What's tonight's moon?

Full.

Of course it is...

With the Moonshadow elves
at the height of their power,

no defense will stand against them.

Then we won't defend. We will attack.

We must find them today,
in the light of the sun,

and stop them before it's too late.

Well done, Rayla.

Yeah. I used both of them.

I can see that.

Bait, shh.

Prince Ezran!
I caught you!

I was just... admiring them.

Oh. With your hands?

Yeah. They look amazing.

Well, they are amazing,
and they're not for you!

Or your little monster, Bait.

Did you just...

You can tell by his eyes he's innocent.

Are you kidding me?
I'm standing right here.

Hey!

Prince Callum.
Today we focus on the art of...

Art! Finally something I'm good at.

Sorry, sorry. Won't interrupt again.

Please... continue, Soren.

The art of defense
is critical in sword-fighting.

Parrying is about angle, motion,
anticipation...

Misjudge your opponent,
and it's over. You ready?

Uh, I'm gonna have to say no.

Great. Let's do this.

Parry, parry, parry... You're dead.

Parry, parry... You're dead.

Parry... Dead.

Really? Are you sure?
Even if I was wearing armor?

Even if you were wearing
the rarest legendary armor,

forged by Sunfire elves...

Super dead.

- I'm terrible at this!
- Yep.

But you have to practice anyway,

because that's what's expected
of a prince.

- Or a step-prince, actually.
- What?

What?

Hey, your sister.

- She's gonna walk right into that...
- Shh.

Claudia!

Oh. Hi, Callum!

You're no fun.

- Is this new?
- Relatively new.

It's only been there for 300 years.

Hey, uh, can we try again?
I think I can do it now.

- What was that?
- I don't know.

Uh, I was trying to "sweep the leg"?

That's not a thing in sword-fighting.

Oh.

I see what's going on here.

Don't worry, I'll help.

You come at me this time.

Oh, I am stabbed!
By the stab-prince!

Lord Stabbington! Why? Spurt!

Spurt!

Nice work, Callum.

He deserves it.

Prince Callum. The King needs
to speak with you urgently.

He didn't really stab me.

Boys!

You're going on a trip.

To the Banther Lodge!

But... it's spring.
That's the winter lodge.

Eh. Winter is coming... eventually.

What will we do? Everything fun there
has to do with snow or ice.

Maybe you can invent new versions
using... dirt and rocks.

You could build a dirt man! Or...

what about mud-sledding?

That could be a thing!

Look, this is something
I need you to do.

- Dad...
- It's decided.

You'll leave before sundown,
so go get packed up.

Yes, sir. Come on, Ez.

Why's he sending us away?
Something's wrong.

Everything's going to be fine.
All right? I'm sure of it.

What's going on, Father?

We have visitors from Xadia...

Unwanted visitors.

What are they, minstrels or something?

- Assassins.
- I know! What do you think, I'm an idiot?

They've set up a secret camp
somewhere near the base of the cliffs.

Soren, you will lead an attack.

Right. Their secret camp.

How am I supposed to find it
if it's secret?

These assassins are Moonshadow elves.

They draw power from the Moon.

Inside this box is an Archangel
Lunaris... a giant moon moth.

It will be drawn to their energy.

Follow it, and you will find them.

And what happens if I can't find them?

Then we may be
on the brink of changing times.

You're saying they'll kill the king?

Discretion, boy!

- Do you want to cause a panic?
- I'm sorry...

Just get out there and find them.
Before sundown!

So, if these are really Moonshadow
elves, then once the moon rises...

They'll be unstoppable.

Well, I'm going to find a way
to stop them.

After all, "unstoppable"
is just another kind of "stoppable."

No. That's not really right.

Yeah, it made more sense in my head.

Wait, I'm coming with you!

You look terrific.

But, just so you know,
that's ceremonial armor.

It's three times as heavy
and half as strong. Oh, but so shiny!

I don't care. I know what's going on
and I'm coming with you.

- You're just a kid, Callum.
- I'll be 15 in two months.

Ooh, fourteen and three quarters! Wow!

Five-sixths. Soren, he's our king.

And he's my father.
It's my duty to help him.

Well, technically he is your step-dad.

But I'm sure it's similar. Think fast!

You were supposed to catch it.

Four full moons past,
on the eve of the Winter's Turn,

the humans crossed into Xadia
and murdered the King of the Dragons.

Then they destroyed his only egg,
the Dragon Prince.

Tonight we bind our lives to justice!

- My breath for freedom!
- My eyes for truth!

- My strength for honor!
- My blood for justice!

My heart for Xadia!

Life is precious. Life is valuable.

We take it, but we do
not take it lightly.

Moon reflects sun, as
death reflects life!

When it is done, I
will send a shadowhawk

with a blood ribbon message
to the Queen of the Dragons.

We strike when the moon is highest!

- Uh, Runaan?
- What is it, Rayla?

I was wondering...
what if they know we're coming?

We have the advantage of surprise.

If we act fast, we will accomplish
our goals without sacrifice.

Oh, Bait, you're terrible
at hide and seek.

- Ez! What are you doing?
- Hi, Callum. Do you want a...

No, I don't want a stupid jelly tart!

Why aren't you packed?
You know we have to get going soon.

But... you're not packed.

What do you think I'm doing?

Ezran! You don't get it, do you?

Why do you think they're
sending us away?

Because they're coming to kill him!

Let's see if this magic moon moth can find
more than a closet full of moon sweaters.

- You know, 'cause moths eat clothes?
- Yes, sir.

Let's go!

They know we're here!

Mystica-Arbora!

Nothing!

Surprising no one, a magic moth
is just as worthless as a regular moth.

We'll have to wait for the elves
to come to us.

You lied to me.

- You let him go!
- Runaan, I'm sorry!

The human... he looked up at me
and I saw the fear in his eyes.

Of course he was afraid.
But you had a job to do!

He didn't do anything to me!
How could I take his life?

You let him live...

but you've killed us all!

Long ago, Xadia was one land...

rich in magic and wonder.

I smell death.

Is that why you summoned me here?
So you could insult me?

You and all your followers must give up
Dark Magic, immediately and forever.

It is humanity's only path forward.

It's a path backward.

You just expect humans to go back

to the way things were
before we had magic?

When humans starved and struggled,
helpless and pathetic?


 


Back to a time when we were lesser beings?

You are lesser beings.

You are arrogant!

Hmm. Lay down your staff and walk away.

Lay it down? But it was a gift.
That would be rude.

- A gift?
- Of course.

You didn't think
that a lesser being like myself

would be able to craft
such a powerful relic?

Who gave you the staff?

- Who?
- One of the great ones.

You... You promised my safety
if I came here!

Yes, you will be
safe high upon this peak...

far, far away from the city of Elarion.

You can't be saying... an entire city?


 


Hundreds of thousands of innocent people!
Children!

Give up Dark Magic
or I will reduce it to ash!

You wouldn't.

No!

That's no ordinary dragon.

Is there such a thing
as an ordinary dragon?

His name is Sol Regem, the Sun King.

He was the king of the dragons
a long time ago.

But he was blinded when the wars began,

and he's become a symbol of rage
and bitterness.

Okay, so, an enormous,
angry, blind dragon

is blocking our path to Xadia.
What do we do?

Well, we can't fight him,

seeing as you've just got
your cute blow spell,

and my swords aren't fit to be
his toothpicks.

We'll have to sneak past him!

Callum, it's time for you
to get your first lesson

- in the ways of stealth.
- Nice!

I... I mean...

Nice.

The secret of stealth
is that you don't have to be invisible.

You just have to be invisible
to your enemy's senses.

Well, he's blind, so we don't need
to worry about his sense of sight.

Exactly. That leaves only two senses
we need to fool, hearing and smell.

Wait, why are those the only two senses
we need to worry about?

Well, if it gets to his sense of touch,
we're in big trouble.

And sense of taste?

Nice knowing you.

Got it.

All this stuff about senses
and appearances,

it kind of sounds like Moon Arcanum stuff.

If you say so, mage.

General Amaya,
we're running out of time.

I strongly recommend we gather
the battalion and abandon the fortress.

General!

General, the Sunfire elves
have already taken over the outpost

on the Xadian side of the Breach.

If the elves mount an attack,

we simply don't have the numbers
to hold this fortress.

When the elves mount an attack.

General Amaya, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but someone has arrived.

Come on, Callum, try to keep him quiet.

I know, it's just...

Ez would know how to calm you down,
wouldn't he?

We just need to trust each other, okay?

I've got you.

What now?

I'm sorry to interrupt,

but where are the reinforcements
we requested?

We sent many messages to Lord Viren.

No reinforcements are coming.

Lord Viren has been arrested for treason.

"Lieutenant, you're right.
We can't defend the Breach.

But I won't abandon it.

Our only choice is to destroy it."

- Do we run for it?
- We'll never make it.

He'll just bite us in half
or slam us with his tail.

So, sneaking is out, running is out,
fighting is out. What's left?

- Burning to death?
- Definitely out.

Looks like it's down to my least favorite
course of action.

Reason.

Mighty Sol Regem,
I am Rayla of the Moonshadow elves.

- What are you doing?
- Uh...

- I am bowing, great dragon.
- No.

I mean, why are you here?

We have been traveling
in the human kingdoms

on the business of Zubeia,
the Dragon Queen.

We humbly ask your permission
to cross back into Xadia.

What kind of business would send you
to the wretched human lands?

We are transporting something precious,
someone precious.

The new-born Dragon Prince, Azymondias!

Lies! You dare lie to me?

The egg of the Dragon King was destroyed!

No! Wait! I have him here.

The Dragon Prince lives!
And he's very cute, isn't he?

There's a good boy!

- How is this possible?
- It is a miracle.

He needs to go back to his home.

Please, allow us to pass,

so we can reunite the Dragon Prince
with his mother.

I do not understand how the Dragon Prince
came to be in the human lands.

However, I will allow you

and the dragonling to pass
back into Xadia.

But not the filthy human
who cowers nearby.

Sol Regem...

- It's okay. You go on without me.
- No! Callum, we're so close.

Rayla, getting Zym to Xadia
is all that matters.

Just tell the Dragon Queen
I helped a little. I'll go back home.

Home? No.

There are two choices.

You all die,

or just the wretched, evil human dies.

I agree with you, Sol Regem.
Some humans are evil.

- Uh, Rayla...
- But not this one. Not Callum.

The only reason the Dragon Prince is alive
is because of this human.

He left his home and his family
to save the egg,

and he sacrificed everything
so Azymondias could be born.

He's noble and true.

When we met,
he could have had me captured or killed.

But he didn't, because without knowing me
or anything about me,

he saw past human hatred
and did what he knew was right.

He's smart and kind and brave, and he's...

my friend.

My best friend.

So, please, allow him to pass into Xadia
and help me take the Dragon Prince home.

Because I don't think
I can do it without him.

I smell death!

What? No, Callum is different.

I smell the reek of Dark Magic on him.

He's no different.

He rips the life
and magic out of innocent creatures.

He must die.

The cable.

"It's done. Let's go."

On your command, we'll pull
the cable and detonate the barrels.

"And a thousand tons of rock
and lava will seal the Breach forever."

I'm sorry, Rayla.

But if me dying is the only way for you
and Zym to get across safely,

- then it's time for me to face the end.
- Calm down.

He can't use his fire breath yet.
He can only do it every few minutes.

He needs time to recharge.

Wait. We can't hide from his senses,
but maybe we can trick them.

Create a false appearance.

After all, we can only truly know
the appearance itself.

- Now you're sounding like Lujanne.
- Wow, really?

- That wasn't a compliment.
- Here's the idea.

I could use Aspiro to blow my scent
to a different place.

Like... like ventriloquism,
but with smells!

- Smelltriloquism!
- Uh...

- Vensmelloquism.
- It's a stupid idea.

But there might be something to it.

Time is up!

Give me your scarf!

If I wear it, I'll smell like you,
and I'll draw his fire.

Once he uses his blast, you and Zym
make a run for it while I keep him busy.

This is the worst idea you've ever had.
He's gonna burn you to a crisp.

No, he won't. I'm faster than him.

And besides,
it's the only chance we've got.

I haven't bathed in two weeks.
This should do the trick.

Right?

Here goes nothing.

We're ready to detonate
the explosives on your command.

Pull!

Now what? The trigger's been disabled.

"Someone has to go out there
and set them off.

I... I'll do it myself."

But, Amaya, you won't survive.

- What did she say?
- She said the rest of us will.

Come on, Rayla, come on!

Foolish human!

That arch. What if...

Throw it!

He wants me to... throw up on the dragon?

Oh, throw it!

Aspiro!

That was amazing!

Too close, but amazing.

Relax, I'm only slightly singed.

Good thinking with Aspiro.

That arch isn't going to hold him forever.

Let's get out of here
before "too close" becomes "too late."

Thanks for letting me borrow this.
I think it's good luck.

Do not despair. Be patient.

Your time will come.

You have put things in motion.

He is too dangerous.

There aren't enough locks and chains
in the Five Kingdoms

to contain the threat he poses.

Then, what are you suggesting?

There's only one way to neutralize Viren.
And that's to do it...

permanently.

What is the meaning of...

King Ezran!

They must be in Xadia by now.

Someday, we'll make it there.

I don't know
if I'm ready for this, Bait.

Oh...

Oh, man.

This is crazy, Rayla! Everything here
radiates with Primal Energy.

- Yup. That's Xadia.
- Wait.

What? You're kidding me.
You are kidding me!

Magic dirt? What?

Save some of that
googly-eyed amazement for later.

We still have a mission.

I'm taking you to my home.

The other elves will help us get Zym
to the Dragon Queen as fast as possible.

And if we get home by dusk,
I can show you something special.


 


- Really? What is it?
- It's a surprise.

You're home now, Zym.

May I offer His Majesty
a freshly baked jelly tart?

Uh, really? It's okay?

Um, sure.

The king requests
a tart of jelly!

Of course.

May I have another?

The king requests
another tart of jelly!

You don't have to repeat everything I say.

The king requests
that you stop repeating!

Uh...

I realized as soon as I said it.

You may have as many tarts
as you care for.

Corvus!

All packed for your journey to the throne?

Would you like a tart of jelly?

No, thanks.

Don't worry,
we can have as many as we want!

I wasn't worried.

Good morning, King Ezran.

High Council meetings
are attended by the council itself

and necessary security, and no others,

unless specifically requested by the king.

Oh, well, I'd, uh... I'd like to request
Corvus to come. Specifically.

That checks out.

Well, what do we do now?

The first order of business is to
review messages received by the kingdom.

Crow Lord?

Crow Lord!

Oh! Sorry, the Crow Lord isn't here.
He's taking a personal day.

And you are?

The Crow Master.
It's similar, kind of like his number two.

If the Crow Lord were to die,
or to be otherwise incapacitated...

Okay, yes, I think we understand.

Can you please read the king his messages?

It's so small.
There can't be too much stuff, right?

You have
417 unread messages.

Your Majesty, if the king so desires,

we could begin
with the messages marked "urgent."

Uh... I do so desire.

That checks out.

It plays music!

Yup. It's a melodaisy.

Rayla. You're pushing us to move too fast.

You know, there's a human saying,

"Sometimes you just have to stop
and smell the roses."

Or listen to them, or whatever.

Maybe you're right, Callum.

Did you know there's a Xadian flower

with a more fascinating scent
than anything in the human kingdoms?

Go ahead, stop and smell this one.

Ugh!

What was that?

Some call them flatu-lillies,
toot-lips, peri-stinkles.

They go by many names,

but at the end of the day,
it's a fart flower.

Zym, no!

Ugh! It's even worse.

I wish Ez were here to smell this.
He'd love it.

Oh, dear. Um... uh...

What's wrong?

I'm not really comfortable reading
some of these things out loud.

Well, can you summarize?

There have been some bad events.

Maybe we should just wait for the
Crow Lord to return, so he can, uh...

Ugh, give me that.

This one also has similar...
bad events.

Assassins.

What?

There have been attacks in other kingdoms.
Successful attacks.

King Florian and Queen Fareeda are dead.

King Ahling is gravely injured.

It appears that Xadia is waging war
on all of humanity.

We are in the middle
of an important discussion!

We've arrested two traitors.
We need the king's judgement immediately.

- How are we going to get down?
- To go down, we need to go up.

Wow. This must be the biggest
tree in the world.

- What do you call it?
- A tree.

Up we go!

Uh...

What's going on?

Why are they chained up?

Your Majesty,
they're Lord Viren's children.

- So what?
- The high mage is in prison for treason.

We suspect they were involved
in his conspiracy.

No, you've got it all wrong.

When Dad sent us after the princes...

Viren sent you after the princes?

Uh... Uh... "Sent" is a strong word.

My point is, he wanted us
to rescue the princes, not kill them!

"Kill them"?

Who said anything
about killing the princes?

No one. That's what I'm saying.
Or not saying.

Ugh, Soren, help!
Tell them we didn't do anything wrong.

King Ezran, they need to be locked away.
Give the order.

But... I'm not really sure
what they were trying to do.

Ezran, please, we talked about this...

Silence!
My king, you need to make a decision.

Okay, but let them rest while I decide.

Get them some food.

Thank you, Ezran.

This is a mistake. They're too dangerous.

You can't just release them.

Fine, fine, keep the chains on.
Until I can make up my mind. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Ugh! How long are they going to keep us
like this?

We're prisoners in our own home.

Well, at least we have bread.

They're still going to give us bread
in the dungeon, right?

We're not going to the dungeon, Soren!
We didn't do anything wrong.

Claudia, I told you,

Dad wanted me to kill the princes.
That means we're guilty.

At least I am.

No, you're not.

I don't know if you misunderstood,
or mis-remembered, or mis-listened,

but there's no way
Dad would tell you to do that.

It doesn't matter anyway.

Dad's in prison, and everyone's
telling Ezran we're guilty, too.

Ezran thinks for himself.

He'll see through this mess,
and he'll do the right thing.

Why are you stacking the bread like that?

It's a bread sandwich.

Ugh!

King Ezran, a visitor has arrived.

Prince Kasef of Neolandia,
eldest son of King Ahling.

Prince Kasef, I heard about
what happened to your father.

I'm so sorry.

Thank you for your condolences.

And the tragedy of your father's loss
breaks my heart.

But the important thing
is that we're here now.

Yes. I'm happy to meet you.

My army stands outside your city gates,
at the ready.

At the ready? What do you mean?

Forgive me,

but was it not a week ago
your regent called on us

to unite against the rising Xadian threat?

Uh... I'm not sure.

Xadia has attacked the human kingdoms.
All of us.

There must be a proportionate response.

I'm sorry,
but, um, I'm kind of new at this.

I'm not really sure what you mean.
What kind of response?

War.

What? No. The people of the human kingdoms
and Xadia want peace.

Am I missing something?
Why is the child on the throne now?

Isn't there an adult advisor
I can speak with?

I'm right here. You can speak with me.

If you can't take action against Xadia,
you have failed as a king.

And you have failed as a son.

Enough! You have a disagreement,
but you are in the court of King Ezran.

Who are you to interrupt
a royal discussion?

I'm Corvus. I was specifically requested.

I'm sure once King Ezran
has had proper council,

he will make the correct choice.

I will remain in Katolis
awaiting your decision.

Get ready. Hold on tight.

- Uh, are you sure this is safe?
- As long as you hold on tight.

- Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to...
- It's okay. It was a bumpy ride.

May I join you?

Sure. Have a seat.

- I noticed you aren't wearing it.
- Wearing what?

Ezran, the crown is
a heavy burden to carry.

There's so much happening.
I don't know what to do.

There's no shame if you aren't yet ready.
No one blames you for being a child.

I feel like
I'm letting everyone down.

- There may be a way out.
- What?

There are capable people around you

who can take up the burden of ruling
for a few years, while you...

just focus on growing up.

You're saying... a regent?

Yes. Someone you trust.
You choose who it is. For a few years.

The crown will be here for you
when you're ready.

Just think about it.

This is so much to handle.

So what do you say, Bait? Be my regent?

I agree. You'd be a tyrant.

We made it just in time.

So, what did you want to show me?

I used to come to this meadow
when I was a kid.

I would spend hours on my own,

exploring and making all kinds
of colorful little friends.

Friends?

What is it?

It's an adoraburr.

They're so cute!

Look! They stick together.
I thought you'd like them.

I love them.

That's nice.
No, really, that look suits you.

Hey...

Hey, these things come off, right?

Have you given thought
to what we discussed?

I have. And I have something to say.

All of you knew King Harrow
as a great king.

He was a leader, a warrior,
and a champion.

But I knew him as my dad,

who loved me and my brother and our mom.

And sometimes told really bad jokes.

I didn't see
everything he had to do as king,

but I do know that my dad
had to make very hard decisions.

I'm just a kid.
I haven't fought in any battles.

I haven't read many books of wisdom.

I haven't gone through the things
that made my father the king he was.

So, I've decided...

that I don't have to be the king
my father was.

My father made choices
to keep fighting battles

that started hundreds of years
before he was born.

To punish enemies for crimes
their parents committed.

I don't want to be that kind of king.

Set them free.

Soren and Claudia will not pay
for the mistakes their father made.

But Your Highness, they are criminals.

Take their chains off!

Katolis will not go to war.

I'm sorry about what happened
to your father,

and what happened to mine,
but we don't have to avenge them.

We don't have to strike back.
We can choose peace.

King Ezran, I admire your courage.

But peace will require
just as much strength as war.

Are you prepared to defend it?

Yes.

I am.

I can't believe I'm almost home.

Somehow I'm happy and excited,
but also terrified.

- [adoraburr squeaking]
- You're just nervous.

Once they see you and widdle baby Zym,
I'm sure they'll help us.

There! Five in a row.
These fellas are so stackable.

When the other elves see me and Zym
is one thing.

But my new human friend
might not be so popular.

[adoraburrs grunting]

But you know who is going to be popular?
Your charming new elf friend.

Oh, no. Please, no.

Get ready to meet...

Elf Callum!

- [Zym yips]
- You know, I'm one of those forest elves,

with the...

with the antlers.

Oh, you're supposed to be
an Earthblood elf?

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
The illusion's not complete.

[exhales]

[in thick accent] Oy, mate.
I'm an Earthblood elf.

All me best mates are trees.

"Mate" is Earthblood for "friend."
High four?

- Down low?
- No, we're done.

[Zym chirps]

[indistinct chatter]

[horses neighing]

[Bait grunts]

Prince Kasef, thank you for coming.

Why have you summoned me?
Have you had a change of heart?

No, but there's something
I want to tell you

that might change your heart.

Try me.

Some bad things have happened,
I know that.

My dad is gone. Your dad is badly hurt.

But there is something
you don't know about.

There is a hope.

This war started because Xadia thought
we destroyed the egg of the Dragon Prince.

But we didn't.

The Dragon Prince is alive!

- And he's really cute, by the way.
- [Bait grunts]

[groans]

And my brother is bringing him
back to the Dragon Queen,

with the help of an elf named Rayla.

When the Dragon Queen sees her baby,
her heart will change.

There could be peace again.
We just have to believe in it.

So, what do you think?

I think you're a little boy
putting his hopes in fairy tales.

[all gasp]

You don't need to throw me out.
We're finished here.

[door slams]

[Saleer] Prince Kasef.

May I have a word?

The human prisoner communicates
in some kind of hand language.

Sign language, actually.

And she probably uses
Katolis sign language specifically.

You see, many of the regions
use different...

Can you translate, or not?

Oh, um, yes, of course.
I was top of my class in linguistics.

Although I don't suppose a hand language
would technically be linguistics.

What would you call it?

Finguistics?

Welcome to Lux Aurea, human.

[yelps]

- [sighs] We're here. My home.
- Here?

Uh, no, I mean, I like it. It's... modest.

[sighs] It's hidden by an illusion.

To get in, I perform a special ritual
that lets me see through the spell.

It's like having a magic key.

Huh. So how do I get in, then?

You'll use my key.

Come on, it's easy. Just do what I do.

[Zym chirping]

[Callum exclaims]

This is it. The Silvergrove.

- Wow.
- Isn't it amazing?

I want to show you everything.

Oh, are you hungry?

I can take you where they make
the best Moonberry Surprise.

Ooh! Moonberry Surprise? What's in it?

I can't just tell you
what's in a Moonberry Surprise, Callum.

Oh, right.

I can show you where I grew up,
where I went to school, and...

- Rayla, something's wrong.
- What is it?

They have no faces.

Oh, no. Oh, no.

What's happening? What's wrong with them?

It's not them, it's me.

I'm... a ghost!

Get up.

Get up. You have visitors coming.

You're going to need to look presentable.

[Claudia sighs]

My children.

I'm so glad to see you safe.

What happened, Dad? Why are you down here?

While I tried to unite the five kingdoms
against Xadia,

the Council was more concerned
that I broke a few rules along the way.

But none of that matters.
The egg, did you get it?

[stammers] It's not an egg anymore.
It's hatched.

It hatched?

That dragon will become
the most powerful creature in the world,

and you've let it fall back
into Xadia's hands?

But, Dad, Soren could've died.
That doesn't matter!

Dad?

[sighs]

I do not mean to be cruel.

But we must be ready to sacrifice.
Even the things we love.

I would have asked you to choose the egg
over my life, if it came to it.

Do you understand?

Everything I do,
and everything I ask of you,

is for the future of humanity.

Is that why you told Soren
to kill the princes?

- Um, hello? Anyone?
- [Zym whimpers]

It's no use.

They can't see me, and they can't see you
or Zym because you came in with me.

I don't get it.

They made me a ghost.
It's like being magically banished.

It's what happened to my parents
when they abandoned the Dragon Guard.

And now it's happened to me.

But you didn't run away from anything.
They just don't know what happened.

Yeah. Yeah, it has to be a mistake.
Come on.

There's one person who will understand.

I'm going to uncuff you now
so you can speak.

Don't do anything stupid.

What were your human soldiers
doing on the Xadian side of the border?

What are the humans planning?

[sighs] I'm losing my patience.

Say something!

[interpreter] Um... oh, my.

Well? What did she say?

If my interpretation is correct,
and it is...

she suggested an unusual way in which
your body might accommodate your sword.

[clears throat]

I suppose you think that's funny.

That's a common sign for "yes."

We'll see if you have the same attitude
with our Queen.

[Rayla] Remember Runaan,
the leader of the assassins?

Uh, I think so.
Tall, pointy, aimed a bow at me?

Mmm-hmm. He seemed nice.

When my parents joined the Dragon Guard,

I went to live with Runaan
and his husband, Ethari.

They were my parents' best friends,
and they took care of me for years.

- We're going to meet Ethari.
- Will he be able to see you?

He wouldn't have done the spell.
He always had faith in me.

[exhales]

Ethari! It's me. I'm so glad you're here.

There's been a mistake.
They made me a ghost.

But you have to tell them,
I didn't run away.

Ethari?

[gasps]

Your Radiance.

We captured this human general
at our border.

But she refuses to cooperate
with my interrogation.

Dispose of her.

No! Ethari, not you, too.

[Zym whimpers]

This isn't fair. There has to be a way
to get his attention.

Hey! Ethari, was it?

You didn't even give Rayla a chance
to explain herself.

Callum, it's no use.

Listen to me! Rayla doesn't deserve this.

I think it worked.

The reflection! He can see me.

Yeah. I'm here.

Surprised to see my face?

- Can he hear you?
- No.

But he can see how I feel.

Rayla.

Before you left, I told Runaan
that you were too goodhearted

for the work of an assassin.

So I know you did not betray them
out of malice.

But that doesn't matter.

They're gone.

He's gone. Because you abandoned them.

[Claudia] Answer me, Dad.

Why did you tell Soren
to kill the princes?

Careful. If you tell the truth,
you will lose her.

You will need her soon.

[laughs]

Oh, is that what you thought, Soren?

Claudia, did you really think
I would ask him to do such a thing?

Surely you know your brother is...

um, easily confused.

Wait, I know I'm not the smartest,

but I know what you said.

Oh, really? What do you remember?

You told me to return with the news
that the princes died.

You said, "Accidents happen all the time."

Soren, I was preparing you for the worst.

I knew tragedy might have
already befallen them...

No! You said that I'd know to do
the right thing.

Soren.

I said "do the right thing,"
and somehow you heard "kill the princes."

Oh... this is disappointing, son.

Even for you.

Claudia, you believe me, right?

Oh, Sor-bear.

I believe you thought you heard it,
but you obviously made a mistake.

We're just really lucky you messed up
the mission you thought you had, huh?

[chuckles] Wow.

High Mage, I've brought someone
who wishes to speak with you.

I understand now. They didn't make it.

None of them. Only me.

How do you know that?

This.

When assassins are sent
on a dangerous mission,

Ethari enchants one of these flowers
for each of them.

As long as the assassin lives
and breathes, their flower floats.

My heart goes out with this one.

Don't worry.
I promise I will return your heart to you.

So when all the others sank,
and yours didn't...

They thought I ran away.
Just like my parents.

But you didn't run.
They have it all wrong.

- Does it matter?
- [Zym chirps]

[chitters]

[Rayla gasps]

If she's not useful, get rid of her.

She's worthless.

She's not worthless.

This may be a human,
but she fought bravely,

and she treated me, her enemy,
with warrior's honor.

Should we not do the same?

Oh, my sweet little sister.

If you truly believe
this one is so special,

we'll let the Light decide her fate.

[gasps]

No, you have to look.

You have to look.

If you want to live,
you have to look into the light!

[panting]

Hmm. A human with a pure heart.
How original.

[scoffs] Just take her.

Thank you, sister.
Enjoy your pet.

Take my hand.

[exhales] There you are.

You know, I was never as strong
as the others.

This will only break the spell
for a moment,

but I couldn't bear to let you leave
without seeing you one last time.

But I don't understand, Rayla.
How could you abandon them?

I failed them.

It was my fault we were discovered,
but I didn't run away.

Ethari, we found something.
Callum, show him.

Oh, uh...

[in thick accent]
I'm Rayla's Earthblood elf friend.

Trees to meet you.

- Trees to meet you, too.
- Don't humor him.

- [Zym chirps]
- We found the Dragon Prince.

The egg wasn't destroyed.

And I knew that if we could get him home
to his mother, there could be peace.

It's a miracle. I can't believe it.

But, Rayla, you need to know.
The Dragon Queen is dying.

Since the death of her mate,
she's fallen very ill.

We have to get to her. It's the only way.

[whistles]

You can ride faster than you can walk.

[beast sniffing]

[Callum exclaims]

- [Zym chitters]
- [Callum grunts]

I'll send a message to the Dragon Queen.

If she knows her little one still lives,
perhaps she'll hold on.

[Callum grunting]

[Zym chirps]

Ethari, can I ever come home again?

I don't know.

It's a real moon opal.

When I gave its match to Runaan,
I told him,

"My love will be with you
even when the moon is not."

Goodbye, Rayla.

Runaan,
the last time I made you one of these,

it carried a message of death.

But this arrow will carry
a message of life.

Regina Draconis!

[bird screeching]

Hmm.

I'm fine. I'm fine.
This is fine.

So, um, yesterday must have been
a hard day for you.

Not really.

Back when I was a kid, my family used to
do this thing called "big feelings time."

You close your eyes, and ask yourself
if you have any big feelings.

Then you say them out loud,

and the other person says
they hear your feelings,

and it makes you feel good.

Humans are so weird.

I'm just saying,
you've been through a lot lately.

It would be understandable
if you had some...

Leave me alone.


 


...big, big feelings.

If you don't stop pestering me
about this right now,

I'm going to give you a big feeling
on the side of your head.

Prince Kasef of Neolandia
requests an audience.

I'm here to deliver an ultimatum.

It means I'm forcing you to make
a final decision.

I know what an ultimatum is.

Does this thing have more pieces?

Katolis and Neolandia were not
the only kingdoms attacked.

The King of Del Bar
and Queen of Evenere were slain.

Their people are angry and want justice.

They are ready to wage war on Xadia.

Their armies have arrived in Katolis.

You dare violate our borders!

We do.

Here is your ultimatum.

If you will not stand with us,
then you stand in our way.

King Ezran, we can show Xadia the strength
and righteousness of the human kingdoms.

Four armies, joined as one!

Enough! I've already told you.
Katolis will not wage war on Xadia.

Then tomorrow at dawn,
three armies will wage war on Katolis.

What are you doing?

Preparing you for greatness.

Now, be still.

Someone's coming.

Greetings, travelers.
My name is Naimi-Selari-Nykantia.

But they call me "Nyx."

Hi, Nyx. My name's Rayla.
They call me "Rayla."

And I'm in a bad mood.
Either you fly away now,

or I'm going to use these blades
to do something that's gonna cheer me up.

Ah, I should have guessed.
You're the banished Moonshadow elf.

What? What are you talking about?

I am an emissary
of the Dragon Queen.

She received your message,
and she sent me to help you.

I am at your service.

And you must be...

I'm an Earthblood elf.
Oi!

Hmm. Message said you'd be
traveling with a human companion.

Oh, does it, now?

That was me all along!
I was the human.

And there he is, the dragon of the hour.
Oh, and he has his mother's eyes.

I have been authorized by the Dragon Queen
to fly him directly home.

That's not going to happen.

We're doing just fine on our own, Nyx.

I can get the baby dragon home fast,
and that's what matters most.

We're not letting you take Zym.

Whoa! Okay, okay, understood.

Well, how about this?
I can give you all a ride.

Not interested.

Are you sure? How do you plan
to cross the Midnight Desert?

Do we look stupid? We're not crossing
through the Midnight Desert.

We're going around it.

The Dragon Queen is dying,
and you would waste a week,

when I can take you straight across
in two days?

How?

Follow me.

King Ezran, Kasef's threat is terrible,
but we can win.

What do you mean?

Your Aunt Amaya,
and your mother before her,

saw to it that our army
was the best trained

and most disciplined force
in the kingdoms.

The coming battle won't be easy,
but we will triumph.

But at what cost?

The necessary cost. Many lives.

- How many?
- No one can say for sure.

- How many?
- I don't know.

Give me an answer, a number.

Thousands. Probably tens of thousands.

That's no triumph.

The Midnight Desert is hot,
haunted, and horrifying.

The black sand soaks up the sun,

so in the daytime it's hotter
than any desert known to elf.

And the night is worse.

That's the haunted and horrifying part?

It's infested with soulfang serpents.

They suck the spirit out of their victims,
turning them into barely-living husks.

But we're going to be above all that.
Literally.

There she is.

That's my ride. An ambler.

She'll get us to the central oasis
by sundown, and we'll spend the night.

Then, tomorrow,
we come out the other side,

and the baby dragon's almost home.

- What do you think?
- The Dragon Queen is dying.

And this is going to save us a week.

Okay, let's ride.

Thanks, Bait. That helps.

Each one of these pieces is 500 people.

Five hundred men and women.
Some are moms and dads,

and have kids waiting for them at home.
All of these are sons and daughters.

Sisters, brothers, friends.

They're real people, Bait.

And after the battle...

How can I let this happen?

King Ezran, forgive me.

There may be a way
to prevent this bloodshed.

You can save these lives.

- What?
- Nothing.

I was just wondering
what you're thinking about.

I'm fine, Callum. Like I already told you.

Ugh, great. Just great.

- What happened?
- Her foot's stuck in a hole.

The soulfangs burrow under the ground
during the day and make all these tunnels,

and if too many are in one place,
the ground gives way.

I just need to go down
and get her foot out.

Don't touch my stuff.

What is it? Why you staring at that thing?

Something's so strangely familiar...

Boomerang?

Let's move.

- Um, excuse me?
- Uh...

King Ezran? Is that you?

We're down here.

Oh! Your Majesty.
I'm so sorry, I had the grate fixed.

Uh... Oh, let me just...
I'll break it for you. Stand back.

Uh...
I'll be sure to leave it broken.

Would you like a jelly tart?

That's not why I'm here, but, yes, always.

I need to ask you a favor.
Something very important.

If anything happens...
I mean, something might happen.

And I need you to take care of Bait.

I am honored and... humbled.

You understand what he needs?

An infinite supply of jelly tarts, and...

understanding and love?

Yes. Mainly the tarts.

Thank you.

Now, I want you to know, I have always
seen you as a kindred spirit.

There's the oasis.

It's not much, but it's a safe haven
from soulfangs and the husks.

How does it keep them out?

It's surrounded by obelisks
that create a circle of protection.

It's a magical barrier around the oasis.

Anyway, here's the Wonderwall.

Looks cozy enough.

It gets really cold here at night,
so we'll need these.

I wasn't sure if you guys
needed two blankets or just one...

Two. Yeah, two.
'Cause if there was just one, then...

- Two.
- Two. Two.

Suit yourselves.

It is ready.

Open your eye.

You can hear me.

And now you can see me.

And I can better serve you.

Rayla? Did you say something?

You okay?

- Rayla, it's okay.
- Get away from me!

Ezran, you don't need to do this.
There must be another way.

Don't worry, Corvus. I'll be okay.

King Ezran, are you sure?
There will be no going back.

I know what's right.
I know what I have to do.

- It's agreed. Everything you asked for.
- The battle?

It's been called off.
There will be no attack at dawn.

And what about the people
who no longer wish to fight at all?

They will be allowed
to lay down their arms,

and return to their families,
in peace and safety, as you insisted.

It's done.

Take him.

I'm so sorry it's come to this.

No, you're not.

No... I'm not.

Please leave me alone.
I don't want you to see me like this.

I don't care if you're crying.
I'm here with you.

I'm a mess.

- No, you're not. It's okay.
- I've lost everything.

My parents, the people who cared about me,
my home.

There's nowhere I belong now.

That's not true, Rayla.

You're going through a hard time,
that's all.

That's not all!
It's me, and it's all my fault.

I failed them. I let them all down.

They're right to reject me.

- I'm not good enough, and I never will be.
- Shut up.

Wait, what?

Just shut up, you're talking crazy.
Just listen to me.

You're too good
to feel this bad about yourself.

I know that, and you should know that.

You have true courage and a big heart.

I've seen you get knocked down
so many times before,

and every single time, you get up again.

That's real strength.

And... and you're ten times funnier
than any human I know.

See?

See, you know you're amazing.
You're smart, and fast, and beautiful.

Rayla, you're the most amazing person
I've ever met.

That's not what I was expecting.

You were saying all those things,
so I thought...

No, I mean, I wasn't saying those things
so you would...

We will never speak of this again.
Do you understand?

Of course. Of course, yeah.
Of course I do.

No, I mean never. I will bind myself
to killing you if you even mention...

Why would I?

No.

- We walk away, and this never happened.
- Perfect.

Oh, no!

Where's Zym?

Hey!
I was hoping you'd be my first visitor.

I wish I could come up there
with you, but...

See? This isn't so bad.

She's got Zym!

We have to stop her
before they get too far into the desert.

Our mounts are gone!
Nyx must have untied them.

Why won't she come?

Soulfang serpents.

You need to stay very, very still.

Uh... Yup! That's my plan.
Still as a mouse.

Wait. Are mice still?

- Or just quiet as a mouse?
- Just do both!


 


No!

We've got to get back inside before...

Run, Callum!

It's too dangerous.
We have to wait until sunrise.

Today is a new day!

Katolis has a new king
and a new royal line.

Wait!

Lord Viren, King Ezran has abdicated.

But just because he stepped down
does not entitle you to take his place.

Oh? And why not?

Because we have laws.

Our laws tell us there is a way
to choose a new royal line.

It's how we've done things for centuries.

Only orphans have a right to ascend.

My parents are dead. Does that count?

Does anyone else here
share Opeli's concern?

Viren, you are not above the law!

I'm afraid you have
misjudged the situation terribly.

I am the law.

All hail King Viren. All hail the king!

All hail the king!

All hail the king!

- All hail the king!
- Come on. It's now or never.

What?

It won't be long before
he goes after traitors. That's us.

We have to flee, now.

All hail the king!
All hail the king! All hail the king!

What do we do? Where do we go?

The Kingdom of Duren.
It's our only chance to find help.

Ugh. Will you stop moving around?

Sorry. I'm just trying
to find a good position.

Oops! See? It's tricky.

Just hold onto me.

Oh, I mean, I guess I could do that?

- If you don't think that would be...
- If I don't think that would be what?

- Weird.
- You're already weird.

Super weird. Just hold on.

Uh, uh... uh, okay, sure. Sure. Not weird.

Putting my arm around you
seems... very normal.

I'm just, uh, gonna do... that.

So how are we going to find them?
Zym and Nyx.

We're tracking them as we speak.

I picked up a thing or two from Corvus.

It's subtle, but if you look closely,
you can find the Ambler's tracks.

Someone's coming.
You need to hide. No glowing.

Soren?

I'm here to help.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

Why are you doing this? Helping us.

Your dad was a good king.

As crown guard, it was my job
to make sure that nothing happened to him.

No matter what.

So, when the Moonshadow elves came,
I did everything I could to protect him.

But it wasn't enough.

I just don't want to fail you, too.

Thanks, Soren.

Is that a mirage?
Or is the Ambler getting closer?

I see it, too.

Its foot is stuck again!

This is our chance to catch up.
Hang on. Hee-ya!

‘Kay, listen up.

We're gonna have to walk across the bridge
without anyone seeing you.

- How are we gonna do that?
- Don't worry. I brought a disguise.

- There's no clothes in here.
- Yeah.

You climb in, and you'll be disguised
as stuff in a sack.

How about I hide in the hay,
and you just pull the cart?

Horses need hay.

I am bringing hay to the horses!

Very hungry horses need hay.

Hungry, hungry horses.

Okay, okay! I'm... I'm sorry.
Please stop yelling at me.

Oh, no, I'm not mad. See ya.

Soren, wait!

The hay... is glowing.

Yeah. Yeah, it is. So?

Nothing. It's pretty neat.

Thanks, man. Hay's the best.

Knock knock!

- Oh, who's your new friend?
- Don't!

Do not touch it.

Sorry, Dad.
I just thought it looked cute.

No. I'm sorry.

I'm just trying to get ready
for our march on Xadia.

Did you need something?

Uh, no!
I was just making sure you're okay.

I mean, you are okay, right?

Thank you. I'm fine.

Claudia, you understand
why Prince Ezran had to be removed?

Of course.

He couldn't have done
the things that need to be done.

Others might take a crown
out of self-importance, but I...

You're doing it to help us.
To help everyone.

Yes. Yes, that's right.

That's why I know
I can count on you, Claudia.

Everything's going to be okay, Dad.
I'm here for you.

Well played. She will be a valuable asset.

She is not an asset. She is my daughter.

Come on out, everybody.

Wow! I can't believe
you all worked together to save me.

Credit where credit is due.
Soren was the mastermind.

"Mastermind." I like it.

That can be my new nickname.
It even rhymes.

"Sor-ine the Mastermind."

That does not rhyme.

I have to go,
or my dad will know something is up.

These guys will take you
to the rendezvous point.

Thanks, Soren. You're the best crown guard
a king could ask for.

She got
the Ambler's foot unstuck.

What do we do now?

We're going to have to do this
the hard way.

No. No, no, no. You're not gonna...

This is crazy. This is totally crazy.

You can make it! I'll catch you!

Ah!

Whatever your stupid scheme was,
it's over, Nyx.

We, uh... We trusted you.

What's the big deal?

I was just taking Zym back to his mum.

He would get home faster,

and I assume I'd get some sweet treasure
or something as a reward.

So, you know, win-win.

Hand. Zym. Over.

Wow.

You really think
you have me cornered, don't you?

You've forgotten something.

Oh, yeah? What's that?

- She's right. We did forget.
- Ugh.

Soren should be here. Why is he late?

Oh, Soren told me
he needed some bathroom time.

He said he ate some bad cheese,
and now he's "paying the price."

You do know what he means
by "paying the price"?

- He means that he's...
- Yes, yes, I get it.

No need to paint a picture.

I would only need
one color for that picture.

Brown.

I am humbled to stand before you.

You are the greatest fighting force
in the history of humankind!

Xadia hates us.

They hate humanity.

And they would destroy us if we let them.

But we will fight back!

But before we embark
on our journey across the world,

a journey that will change history,

there is one unpleasant matter.

What?

You see, Ezran, in his last act as king,

insisted that all those
who no longer wish to fight

be allowed to lay down their arms.

Well, go on, leave us, cowards.
We don't want you anyway.

No, no, let them be!

Let them return safely to their families.

But even their families will know
that they are deserters.

They will wear a badge on their clothing.

A badge of shame and cowardice,
a broken link!

A chain is only as strong
as its weakest link.

It is better to be rid
of our weak links today!

Sorry I'm late. What'd I miss?

What do we do?
How can we follow them when she's flying?

Look!

Hey, cut it out,
you little zap monster! Ah!

Here we go!

Wow! How'd you learn to do that?

I've never done that before in my life!

Zym! You're okay.

I'm so sorry we lost you.

Ow. Careful.

Help! Help me!

My wings are hurt. I can't fly.

Soulfangs.

Why did it have to be soulfangs?

You're going back to Xadia
and finding your brother.

As soon as your ride gets here.

I was surprised to receive
a message from Katolis.

It's not signed, but I assume
it's from the strapping young idiot.

"Dear Moon Lady..."

Ugh. But I am happy to help.

Goodbye, Opeli.
Thank you for believing in me.

I serve the true king.

Corvus, I'm sorry I let you down as king.

It only took me a few days
to mess everything up.

Are you kidding?
In your first few days as king,

you showed more courage,
strength and grace

than most leaders show in a lifetime.

Oh.

Goodbye, Ezran.

Ho, ho, ho. Goodbye, Bait.

Time to go, Ezran.

Phoe-Phoe will be strongest
traveling at night.

Whoo!

So, how are you going to get home?

Oh, I thought I might spend a few days
travelling in disguise,

messing with some humans.

How do you humans say it?

Party time!

Please. You have to help me!

Callum, get Zym back to the Ambler.

- Stay right behind me.
- Okay.

Callum! Why aren't you running?

Right. Sorry. Sorry.

So, why did you save me?

Even after I tricked you and betrayed you?

It's because I'm charming, right?

Despite it all,
you can't help but like me?

Nope, that's not it.
I do not like you at all.

Oh. Then, why?

- It's because Rayla is a hero.
- What?

Rayla saves people. She's brave.

She does what's right,
even if it puts her own life in danger,

and even when the odds seem impossible.

Even when it means her own people
might misunderstand and turn against her.

Rayla is selfless, strong and caring.

That's what makes her a hero.

That's what makes her Rayla.

You are so...

Oh, no. I'm so... I'm sorry.
I just got carried away.

Next thing I knew, my lips
were getting way ahead of me, and...

Shut up.

What?

Wow.

Wake up, love bugs. This is your stop.

Whoa!

So, what do we do from here?

Well, the dragon's lair
is only about a day's journey.

They call it the Storm Spire.

Big, tall, mountainy-tower thing,
pierces the clouds? You can't miss it.

So, uh, again, thanks for not killing me.


 


You know, for conning you,
and then betraying you,

stealing your dragon,
and leaving you stranded in the desert.

No tip?

I suppose that's fair.

A word of advice, the air can get
pretty thin up there.

Hey, looks like I gave you a tip!

Guess we're even now.

Bye!

Phoe-Phoe, you've been flying all night.
You must be exhausted.

Are you sure
you don't want to stop and rest?

How are you tired?

What, you don't want me
to smoosh that thing?

Do not smoosh the purple creature.
Think of it as my animal familiar.

So, you're saying
you've adopted a little bug-pal?

Yes, Soren.
He is my little bug-pal.

I'll just ride back here
with Claudia for a while.

Has our relationship truly escalated
to this new height?

Am I your "little bug-pal"?

We have a long journey ahead.

While we travel, there is something
I have been meaning to ask you.

My understanding is that somehow
you killed Avizandum.

I've killed no such person.

Avizandum was no person.

Avizandum was an archdragon,
the great king of all the dragons.

The most powerful creature in the world.

Yet, somehow, you brought him down.

So, Avizandum was his true name.
We called him... Thunder.

We encountered the great dragon
many years ago.

We had dared to enter Xadia
because we desperately needed something.

And in his fury to drive us out...

Thunder killed our queen,
the love of King Harrow's life, Sarai.

Many years passed
before I saw a chance to avenge her.

...eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

Ready or not, here I come.

Now, where could
that clever little glow toad be hiding?

Hmm.

Bait's not back here.

I think I hear him.

I smell him.

I sense his grumpiness.

He's close, I know it.

I give up.
Bait is a hiding genius.

Gotcha!

Ah, Viren. Care to join
the next round of hide-and-seek?

No cheating with magic.

Uh-huh, perhaps next time.

High Mage Viren and I are going to talk.

Okay, Dad. Come on, Bait.

My king, an unusual opportunity
has presented itself.

We can avenge her, Harrow.
We can slay the King of the Dragons.

Are you crazy?

Thunder is bigger and stronger
than any beast the world has ever seen.

Entire armies have fallen and crumbled
like toys before him.

How can we hope to kill
such a godly creature?

I have discovered a powerful spell.

We can create
the ultimate weapon of vengeance.

On that fateful day, so many years ago,
Queen Sarai saved my life,

but minutes later, after Thunder struck,

there was nothing I could do to save hers.

I watched as her spirit
passed from the world.

Go on.

In her final moments,

I captured something
that I hoped we could use later.

- It's empty.
- No.

It contains her dying breath.

Viren...

You see, I knew about
a very ancient, powerful spell.

However, it requires something
impossibly rare, the horn of a unicorn.

I searched for years and I failed,

but a few days ago, my daughter Claudia
succeeded where I could not.

She captured a unicorn
and brought me its horn.

Viren, what have you done?

Tell me you don't want justice.
Tell me she wasn't your world.

The dying breath. The unicorn's pure horn.

There's one last component I need.

The undying hatred
of one who loved the victim.

Your blood.

I know your heart still burns with anger.
Avenge her, Harrow!

It's been a long time.

Our kingdom is prospering. There is peace.
My boys, they're growing up.

Perhaps it's wiser
to stay focused on these blessings.

She didn't get to see the princes grow up.
She should have.

Yes, it's true.

And what about them?
They were robbed of their mother's love.

I do hate him.

I will leave you
with your grief.

Hey, man. I'm Soren.
I don't think I caught your name.

Kasef. Prince Kasef.

Right, right.

Do I detect a little accent?

Ooh, let me guess.
You're from that one kingdom...

You know the...
you know the one I'm talking about.

Uh, uh, the...

Noodleoodlia.

Neolandia.

Yeah.
That's exactly what I just said.

Noodleoodlia.

I can't believe it.

This is the moment
I've dreamed of my whole life!

We're going into Xadia!

Phoe-Phoe, you did it! You got us here.

Phoe-Phoe? What's wrong?

Phoe-Phoe! You're exhausted and sick.

You got us to Xadia.
We can find them on our own now.

You need to go home
so you can rest and get better.

I know Lujanne told you
to bring me all the way,

but you have to promise me you'll be okay.

She says she has to see this through.

Ugh.

Your brother, Soren, he's a bit... quirky.

Hmm. People usually say
I'm the quirky one.

And your father, is he talking to himself?

What? No, of course
he's not talking to himself.

That'd be crazy!

He's talking to his little bug-pal.

Uh-huh.

Please, continue.
I eagerly await the great confrontation.

We did not find Thunder... Avizandum...
where we expected to find him.

Where is he?

He's always guarded this border jealously.

But today, when we've come for him,
he hides?

No.

If he's not protecting the border,

it's because he's protecting something
more important.

It took us days
to reach our destination...

the lair of the Dragon King and Queen!

Here he comes.

Leave.
Today, of all days, I will spare you.

But you must turn around
and leave Xadia. Now.

No.

Today is a special day, a day of life.

Do not force me to make it a day of death.

This is your last chance. Leave or die!

You never gave her that choice.

What is this?

We've done it. It's over.

No, it's not.

What do you mean?

The reason he was here
and not at the border.

He was protecting something very precious.

His egg!

His mate must be gone.

That's why Thunder
was willing to spare us.

He needed to get back to that egg!

So what? Why does that matter?

- We must destroy it.
- What?

- No.
- We have no choice, Harrow.

Don't you see? If that egg hatches,
all of us will be in terrible danger.

From a baby dragon?

After what we have done,
his name will be "vengeance"!

His destiny will be
the destruction of humanity.

Give me one chance to clean this up.

And then it will truly, finally be over.

It's... horrific, Viren.

There is no other way.

Do it.

Is it a statue?

No. It's not a statue.

Shh. Hey, it's okay, little guy.

You're safe, you're safe.
We're here with you.

That sounds like...

Phoe-Phoe?

What an incredible story.

I am delighted you took down
that arrogant monster.

It sounds like you have
a history with Avizandum.

Oh, I do.

He is the reason I am where I am today.

And where is that?

He never bothered to mention
where he imprisoned me.

You're imprisoned?

Your home looks like no prison
I've ever seen.

Yes, it's well appointed.

But make no mistake,

this has been my prison
these past few centuries.

King Viren, I have some bad news.

We've received word that the Breach
has been completely destroyed.

- What?
- Without the Breach to cross into Xadia,

our armies are stranded on the human side.

The border is completely impassable.

We're going to cross that border.

After all...

impassable is just
another kind of passable.

Yes!

Ez? Ezran!

Zym, Zym! I missed you so much!

Ezran?

Callum! Rayla!

Ezran, what are you doing here?

Let's just say that being king
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

Are you okay? Are you hurt?
Let me look at you.

I'm fine, Callum! I'm safe now.

Phoe-Phoe?

Oh, no. She flew the whole way here.

She's so tired,
but she wouldn't let me stop her.

You did so good, Phoe-Phoe,
and now we made it.

No! You've got to be okay.
You promised me you'd be okay.

She is going to be okay.
She's a Moon Phoenix!

When the time is right, she'll be reborn!

I hate him.

He's the one who took my mother.

Oh...

Looking at him, seeing him...

It makes me sad, and angry, and...

confused.

Of course it does. It's painful.

How could you feel any different?

See that spear?

That was her spear, my mom's.

And my stepdad put it into his heart.

How am I supposed to feel about that?

I don't know, Callum.

Glad?

Happy that we got revenge?

Or maybe regretful...

and sad, because...

Because what?

Because that was Zym's dad.

I feel so sorry that this all happened.

Me too, Callum.

But look at them, playing together.

That's the miracle. That's hope.

They're the ones
that are going to break the cycle.

Aw, you're so cute.

Just too cute!

Hey, wait up!

- Hey, Dad?
- Soren.

I just have one question.

Now that we're in Xadia...
or should I say, New Katolis?

Or East Katolis?

Or Katol-east?

Get on with it, son.

What's the plan?

You do not need to concern yourself
with the plan.


 


I mean, you do have a plan, right?

My plan will be revealed
at the appropriate time.

I am a Crown Guard.

Shouldn't the leaders know
what's going on?

Enough, Soren!

If you want to lead,
you need to learn how to follow.

And if you want to learn to follow,
you need to learn how to shut your mouth.

Perhaps you could look to Prince Kasef
for an example.

You think you're so great,

with your quietness, rugged battle stance,
and your horse with kind eyes!

- So, what is the plan?
- To fulfill your wishes, of course.

- Is your wish to rule Xadia?
- I wish for humanity to flourish.

And it cannot flourish
with a knife forever at its throat.

So, you wish to conquer Xadia?

No!

No, my goal is a bright future
for humanity.

Right.

And this bright future will require us
to conquer Xadia?

Yes. Yes, perhaps.

The key to achieving your noble aims
for humanity is simple.

It's the same as it has always been.

The key is the Dragon Prince.

Yes.

You must take down the Dragon Queen
and capture the baby dragon.

Then you will have the attention
of all the world,

and the power to do what you want.

But first, there is
something we need here in Lux Aurea.

You want us to attack the stronghold
of the Sunfire elves?

But we need to preserve our forces
for the final confrontation.

Viren, I'm nothing if not elegant
and efficient.

We'll risk as few lives as possible...

one.

Ah, mine.

Yes.

So, this is it. The Storm Spire.

Yup.

And I take it
the Dragon Queen didn't make her lair

at a nice kinda halfway-up there
kind of place?

Nope. Tip-top!

Aw, Zym. Don't worry.

You're about to meet your mama!

Your radiance, another human has come
to Lux Aurea.

He requests an audience.

You see, sister?

You bring one human,
and the next thing you know,

we are overrun with them.

Throw him in a cell.

But this human is the King of Katolis!

Oh?

Then put him
in the extra-nice ring of fire.

Sister, this human claims he knows
what happened to Queen Aditi.

What does he know about our grandmother?

So, uh, when we get up there,

are we gonna tell
the Dragon Queen we're... a thing?

Uh, I don't think it's gonna come up.

Oh, I see.
You're saying we should hide it from her.

Kind of a secret,
forbidden-romance situation?

Yes. Yes, that's right.

The Dragon Queen must never know!

I understand.

The world just isn't ready
for what we have.

This is elven writing.

Can you read it?

It says...

"Prepare to draw your last breath."

What do you know of my grandmother?

Allow my people safe passage
through Xadia,

and you will know the truth.

Your people?

Do you bring farmers and poets,
or do you bring an army?

Humans bring nothing but trouble,
and you are like all the rest.

If you allow us to pass,
we have no trouble with you.

Hmm. We will see if we can trust you.

The Light will decide!

Look into the Light!

Ahh!

Your true form is revealed.

Ugly and evil. I am not surprised.

But don't give up hope,
you will be purified.

You know, I think this interrogation
is going very well.

You're not dead.

Bad news, my human friend.

Your king came seeking passage.

What? That's impossible.

The Light
revealed his true nature.

- Tainted with darkness, rotten to the core.
- Such an arrogant man.

That man is no king.

He may be the most dangerous human
in the world.

No matter.
The queen sentenced him to be purified.

After the ritual, I doubt there
will be anything left of him.

You don't understand.

If he's here, everyone is in danger.
We have to stop him!

How tall is this thing?

Maybe we should just rest here
for a second.

Guys, we can't stop here.
We have to keep going.

There is nothing
to be afraid of.

The light from the Sun Forge
is one of purification.

It will only remove the parts of you
that have been touched by Dark Magic.

The ritual has started!

We have to stop him!

Ugh! Humans disgust me.

Your kind could not be satisfied
with what you were given.

So you take what is not yours.

You take it within you,
and you turn it to filth.

Your arrogance is so predictable.

You allowed my vessel
to walk right into your court,

and then you brought him
directly to the source of all your power?

Oh, the irony is wonderful!

You're just like your grandmother.

Would you like
to know the truth of her fate...

before you face yours?

No!

No!

The air's so thin.

I can barely breathe.

Thanks.

It's too much.

Zym, we can't leave them here.

I don't know if I can keep going.

Zym!

Zym, how long was I out?

Hey!

I've met you before, when you crashed.

You're okay now!

I understand!

Dad?

I have been granted a great gift.

The power we need to defeat Xadia

and save humanity is now ours!

We must evolve.

When we strike against the Dragon Queen,

we will face elves and dragons,
and they will rain fire upon us.

But with this gift, I will inoculate you.

And instead of destruction,

that fire will be our nourishment!

Now, come forth.

Do not be afraid.

You will understand when you see the first
to change...

my own beloved son, Soren.

Step forward, my son.

Let me help you.

I don't wanna do this.

Step forward.

I... I'm afraid.

I am ready!

I am ready to receive the gift!

Guys! Wake up! You gotta wake up!

I know how to fix everything.

The gateway wasn't a warning.
It was the solution!

What? What are you talking about?

To make it all the way up,
you have to draw your last breath.

It's a rune, Callum!

And the trigger words are Ventus Spiralis.

How do you know all this?

I met an old friend.

Ventus Spiralis!

Rayla, wake up! Come on!

We're gonna be okay!

Hey, that isn't part of the spell.

Uh, yeah! So, uh...
you were gone for a while,

and now, uh, this is a thing, so...

What?

Wha...

Soren. What's going on?
Where are you going?

I can't stay here anymore, Claudia.
You've seen what's going on.

What Dad turned Kasef into.
What Dad turned into.

Maybe he's just doing
what needs to be done.

Claudia, you're changing, too.

But it's not too late.

Come with me, Claudia. You can leave him!

Please, Soren, don't...
don't do this to me.

Don't make me choose. Not again!

Okay.

Good bye, Clauds.

No!

No! No, no, no!

Now, it is time for all of you
to embrace this power!

We're here.

I can't believe we've made it!

We've brought him home.
Azymondias, the Dragon Prince!

He's here to see his mother.

It makes my heart leap
to see that he lives.

But you're too late.

We've brought him home.
Azymondias, the Dragon Prince!

It makes my heart leap
to see that he lives.

But you're too late.

The Dragon Queen
has not opened her eyes in ten days.

But she's not...

No, no, she's not dead.

She lives and breathes, but...
she is not with us.

My name is Ibis,
mage of the Skywing elves.

When I heard that Queen Zubeia was ill,

I thought I could use my magic
to help her.

Losing her mate and her egg
had irreparably broken her heart.


 


Finally, she closed her eyes,
and has not opened them since.

Come. I will show you.

Don't worry, Zym. She's your mother.

Don't you wanna see her?

You're not ready yet.

I understand. It's okay.

We'll go in first. I'll be right back.

Wake up. Your baby's here.

You have to wake up.

You okay?

This is where it happened, Callum.
Where my parents ran away.

I can't stop thinking about that moment.

How it led to all of this.

Being here... it hurts.

Thanks for getting me
this far, buddy.

You're free now!

Start a new life
for yourself here in Xadia!

Maybe you'll meet a nice,
uh, unicorn, huh?

All right, mountain.
Prepare to be dominated!

Come on, Soren!

What were all those workouts for?

You can do this!

Oh...

Maybe I shouldn't have... done this...
in... armor.

You.

Come to finish me off?

- Soren?
- Huh?

Is that you?

Callum! Rayla! We need your help!

This guy?

What's Soren doing here?

Stop asking questions! Help him!

Oh, right. Breathing.

Ventus Spiralis!

Is this... the afterlife?

No, it's still just... the life... still.
You're alive.

What are you doing here?

Hold on. Give me...

Give me a second to catch my breath.

Okay.

We're all doomed.

- It's my dad.
- Lord Viren? He's here in Xadia?

He's rallied the armies of four kingdoms,
and it's not just that.

We went to the... Sun elf place?

And my dad...
he stole some kind of horrible power.

And he used it
to transform his armies into...

into something else.

What do you mean?

They're stronger, angrier, big... claws!

He's made an army of darkness
and he's leading them here... for him.

The Dragon Prince.

I did use the word "doomed."

- Hey, uh, Ibis, was it? Where you going?
- To the pinnacle.

I must see how long we have before
this army of darkness is upon us.

I'll scout from the sky.

Oh, good.

Uh, how are you gonna do that?
You don't have wings.

Sorry, is that rude? Is it...

It's just... we met another Skywing elf,
and she had wings,

so I thought you all had wings? Sorry.

Do not worry. My ego is unharmed.

All Skywing elves are indeed born
connected to the sky.

But fewer than one in ten of us
are born with wings.

Of the rest of us, only a rare few
can learn to do this.

Manus. Pluma. Volantus.

Mage wings!

That's amazing.

You have got to teach me how to do that!

Teach you?

My apologies, but a human cannot...

Fulminus!

Look, I've heard it before.

That humans can't do magic,
that it's not my destiny,

but I know the Sky Arcanum.

And with that army coming here,

I'm going to need to learn all the magic
I possibly can.

So, please... teach me.

Hmm... to learn an Arcanum as a human.

Such a thing is unheard of.

But if I may offer instead
some helpful advice?

- Leave.
- Uh, what?

Take the Dragon Prince far away from here.

Run, hide, survive.

But we came all this way!

And it will mean nothing
if you throw your lives away here.

Leave, while you still can.

Well? Did you get him
to teach you any neat sky spells?

Tornado punch! Lightning lash!
Storm sneeze?

No.
But, uh, he did have some advice.

He says we should leave.

- Leave?
- I think... maybe he's right.

Every choice we've made so far has been
to keep Zym safe...

so, maybe leaving
is the right thing to do.

Yes.

I agree.

Okay, I'll tell Ezran and Soren.

But... I'm not going with you.

What?

You and Ezran should take Zym,
but I can't leave.

All of this happened
because my parents ran away,

so I have to stay
and defend the Dragon Queen.

But you can't face an entire army
by yourself, you'll...

Die?

Probably.

But if I die, I'll just be paying the
price they should've paid a long time ago.

Just... remember me, okay?

Goodbye, Callum.

Really? So, that's it? Just... goodbye?

You're going to stay here
and die out of pride?

It's not pride, Callum!
It's more than that. It goes deeper.

Oh? Do you have a nicer word for it?
Honor? Redemption? It's just pride!

Please, Callum, this is about who I am.

Don't let your parents' mistakes
drag you down.

I know you feel guilty,
but you're not thinking straight!

Rayla, you have to let it go!

If you think I can just let it go,
then you don't know me at all.

You never did.

It's a moon opal.

I wonder if it could...

Historia Viventem.

What really happened here?

Historia Viventem!

He's turned
the Dragon King to stone!

We have no choice, we have to leave!

Now!

It's them!

I know what happened.

Callum, I don't want to talk about it.
I won't change my mind.

No, no, no. I did a spell to see
what happened back then,

when Viren took the egg.

What are you talking about?
That's impossible.

It's true!

That's them.

My parents.

You really did see them.

When Viren came to destroy the egg,
some of the Dragonguard did run.

All of the others have already fled.
You know we can't win this. Come with us!

No, we swore an oath.

If there's any chance,
we must stay and fight!

So long as the egg lives, there is hope.

Then stay and die.
It's a pointless sacrifice.

Wait! Can't you at least take it with you?

And make myself a target? Are you mad?

You made a mistake coming here!

What are you doing to him?

Aspiro Frigis!

Now, you may witness history...

as I end a dynasty by destroying
that dragon's egg.

Wait!

You're a Dark Mage.
You must know the magic that egg holds.

It could be a powerful weapon.
Why would you destroy it?

What are you doing?

Don't waste it, mage. Keep the egg alive.

Hmm.

Wise counsel, indeed.

How might I repay you?

Ah!

I have just the fate in mind.

They didn't run. They fought.

To the end.

They saved the egg!

We're here and Zym is alive
all because of them.

What does this mean?

- What should I do?
- I don't know.

But it's your choice. No one else's.

We should decide together.

Here's our situation.

Viren is coming here for Zym,
and he's leading an army of monsters.

The Dragon Queen is sick,
and we don't know when she'll wake up...

if she'll wake up.

So, we have a choice to make.

We can try to take a stand here,
or we can go on the run,

and protect Zym as long as we can.

So, uh... hi.

Uh, I know I'm not really
part of the group,

but can I say something?

I've known Viren
longer than anyone here.

I mean, because he's my dad.

But it took me a long time to understand
who my dad really is.

And it was hard to see,
because I really...

I really looked up to him.

He's smart, and the way he talks,

you really believe
that he's a good person,

that everything he does
is to protect his family, his home,

or all of humanity.

He makes you think that
as long as you do what he says,

you must be doing the right thing.

Even when he asks you to do something bad.

Something... evil.

So, the truth is,

someone who wants
you to do horrible things,

and convinces you that they're good,

that's a villain.

My dad... is a villain.

And he's only gonna get more powerful,

and the more powerful he gets,
the more people will listen to him,

and believe him, and follow him.

So, maybe we could run,
and we'd be safe for a while, but...

he's not gonna give up.

It may seem hopeless,
but our only chance is to fight him here.

While we're all together.

The only way to stop this is to look evil
in the face and say, "No more."

I was wrong.

You are more than just a big,
dumb lump, aren't you?

Maybe a little more.

So, we stay.

All of us.

We all agree?

All right, then.

We fight.

The Dark Mage's army
will be here by daybreak.

But there's something else.

Come outside.

Aunt Amaya!

Oh, right, uh...

All that stuff at the Banther Lodge,
it was a big misunderstanding.

I'll explain later, but Rayla is...
our friend.

Uh, looks like you have
an elf friend now, too?

We are not... friends. She is my prisoner.

I am Janai, Golden Knight of Lux Aurea.

I've brought my city's forces.
What's left of them.

They wait at the bottom
of the Storm Spire,

ready to fight the monster
who destroyed our home.

I know you said we should run,
but we wanna help.

We wanna fight.

Then we will need all the help we can get.

Manus. Pluma. Volantus.

Do you really think so?

We're going to find more help, too.
Big help.

Wow.

My little brother,
all grown up and riding dragons.

This is it, huh?

This is it.

Perfect.

Manus, Pluma, Volantus!

My arm is itching a little.
Maybe it's starting to work?

Did you pull a muscle
in the middle of a jumping jack?

Oh, uh, no.

I was just...
greeting the sunrise.

Hello, sun, how's it going?

You know, it's a big day.
Could be our last.

Yeah.

To be fair, that's true every day.

Okay, but to be even more fair,
it's not every day

that you get attacked by an army
of 10,000 monster-soldiers.

Rayla, if today is our last day,
I want you to know...


 


Hey, guys!

Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!

Time for the battle meeting! Ding-ding.

So, like, I wanna say something to you.

You know all those times
I called you the step prince,

or made fun of you,
or knocked you down and stuff?

- You remember that?
- I do. I do remember that.

Well, I'm sorry.

It was wrong and I'm sorry for it.

I think it was because

even though the king was your stepdad,
it was...

it was so clear how much he loved you,

and that made me feel...
jealous and upset.

So, I picked on you,
because I didn't know any better.

Also because you're smaller and weaker.

Oh, thanks... I guess.

And slower... I forgot slower.

So, should we, like, hug or something?
You know, to seal the apology?

Is that a thing?

Uh, I don't know if that's necessary... Oh!

I am proud of you, Claudia.

Despite everything,
you have stood beside me.

Well, of course.
You're my dad, Dad.

I know, it's just...

You have grown up so brilliant and strong.

But you are still my little girl.

We're all that's left of our family,
and I won't let anything break us apart.

When you capture the dragonling,
I will show you how to take his power,

how to imbue yourself
with all his magic and potential,

so that you will transcend
the limits of your human form.

Then none will dare stand against you.

"We have one objective today,
protect the Dragon Prince."

At any cost.

The forces of Lux Aurea
will fight bravely,

to the last elf standing.

"We will be outnumbered,
but their forces are vicious and sloppy.

Our job is to hold the line."

So, what happens if some break through?

"That's when our natural advantage
comes into play.

The spire itself.

While they try to climb up,
they'll be vulnerable,

and that guy can pick them off easily."

And by that guy, she means this guy...
and my zap hand! Yeah!

Pew! Pew!

I'll stay here with you.

No matter what else happens,
I will keep you safe.

You will be a worthy defender.

The last Dragon Guard.

Aww...
Dad, look, they have shields.

Maybe we should just give up
and turn around?

Everything is ready.
We only wait on your command, King Viren.

- Uh...
- Ugh, it's fine. Let's just do this.

Wait...

Wait...

Drop!

For Lux Aurea!

Go, go, go!

Noctu Igne!

Hold the line! Push them back!

Oh, no. They're coming.

It's Ezran!

And he's brought help!

Dragon friends! Whoo!

Brace yourself.

Tenebris Praesidium!

The soldiers! They're immune to the fire!

So much more than that.

They're strengthened by the blaze!

It is time for the next phase of our plan.

I understand.

No! Don't land!
You've gotta stay in the air!

Hey, there.
It's going to be okay, wee fella.

You're ready to see your mother.

I'll go in with you, but, Zym,
I don't want you to get your hopes up.

She's in a deep, deep slumber,

and I don't think she's waking up
any time soon.

It's okay. She's your mother.
You can go to her.

Aspiro!

Don't even try it.
I got more wind where that came from.

Fulminis!

Fulmin...

Ready! Launch!

Forward!

- The tide is turning!
- I love how you say that!

For King Ezran!

- Are you okay?
- Yeah!

Of course. Are you?

This morning, I thought we were doomed.

Then the dragons came,
and I thought we would win.

But then things got doomed again.

But now we're okay!

It does feel great to not be doomed.

Go to her.

- What?
- Rayla.

It's okay. I got this.

I am so proud of you.

I know.

You fought bravely.

Thank you.

My name is Marcos.

Now that the battle's over,
we need to help the wounded,

and we need to free these dragons.

"I'm worried. This is not over
until we find Viren.

We cannot let him slip from our grasp."

I'll order a massive search
of the entire battlefield.

We will find him and capture him.
We won't let him get away.

It feels a lot better to be
on the side that's unchaining things.

Claudia?

Claudia, wait!

Oh, I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to run into you like that.

Are you okay?

Please, let me help you.

Ahh!

No!

Drop the staff, Father.

It's over.

I am a Crown Guard,
and he is the true king.

I will do whatever is necessary
to protect his life,

because now I know
what the right thing to do is.

Do you hear me?

Soren, wait!

You're making a mistake!

Lay down your staff... and surrender.

How could you?

I... I had no choice.

Why would he try to hurt me,
when it's so clear he couldn't win?

The battle is over.

- No, it's not.
- What?

The real battle was never down here.

All of this... was just a distraction.

He was just an illusion!
Claudia, where is he?

Oh, no! Zym is in danger!

Your mother can't protect you now.

So still.

So perfect.

I'll harvest her later,
but first, it is time to consume you.

Zym, run!

Ugh.

You haven't saved him.

You've done nothing
but create a brief inconvenience for me.

I'll return for you soon.

It will be a pleasure
to add one more Moonshadow elf

to my collection.

There is no escape.

Come on, Rayla!
You can't give up now!

Bait! You're my hero!

Yes! Yes!

Oh, such power!
I can feel it surging into me!

You're too late.

I've already won.

No!

No, no, no! Rayla!

Manus, Pluma, Volantus!

Oh, please work, please work.

Manus, Pluma, Volantus!

Rayla... I love you.

Manus, Pluma, Volantus.

- Callum! But how did you...
- 'Cause I love you, Rayla.

I really do.

I love you too, Callum.

Phew.

Well, I'm happy to see you, too.

I just can't believe it.
Everything we've been through together.

Traveling across the world,
coming here to Xadia...

We did it!

We changed things.
We made a difference.

Just the four of us.

Five of us.

"Hey! Just the five of you, huh?"

Uh... I mean all of us!

Is this... a dream?

I can't believe it.

Elves and humans are here...

and they've brought back my baby,

my love,

and my hope.

What...

What... what's going on?

You're alive!

Somehow, I...

I survived the fall?

No. You didn't.

But... you're okay now.

Where is...

Your creepy caterpillar friend?

Two days ago it climbed up
that wall, and spun itself... into that.

It's changing.
