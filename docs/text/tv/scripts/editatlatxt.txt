Katara, I think you were right before.

I'm done dwelling on the past.

Really?

I can't make guesses about
how things would have turned out

If I hadn't run away.

I'm here now, and I'm going
to make the most of it.

I don't think you're gonna have
those nightmares anymore.

If you weren't here now...

Well, I guess, I wouldn't be either.

Thank you for saving my life, Avatar.

Do you hear that?

It stopped raining.

[GRUMBLING]

AANG: Uh! Appa!

[BIRD CALLS]

Absolutely not.

The Yuyan archers stay here.

Your request is denied,
Commander Zhao.

Colonel Shinu, please reconsider.

Their precision is legendary.

The Yuyan can pin a fly
to a tree from 100 yards away

without killing it.

You're wasting their talents
using them as mere security guards.


 


I can do whatever I want
with their talents.

They're my archers,
and what I say goes.

But my search for the Avatar is...

Is nothing but a vanity project.

We're fighting a real war here,

and I need every man
I've got, commander.

But...

That's final!

I don't want to hear
another word about it.

[BIRD SCREECHES]

News from Fire Lord Ozai?

It appears I've been
promoted to admiral.

My request is now an order.

[COUGHING]

This should bring your fever down.

You know what I love
about Appa the most?

His sense of humor.

That's nice.

I'll tell him.

Ha ha ha!

Classic Appa.

How's Sokka doing?

Not so good.

Being out in that storm

really did a number on him.

[SHIVERING]

I couldn't find
any ginger root for the tea,

but I found a map.

There's a herbalist institute

on the top of that mountain.

We could probably
find a cure for Sokka there.

Aang, he's in no condition to travel.

Sokka just needs more rest.

I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow.

[COUGHING]

Not you, too.

Relax. It was just a little cough.

I'm fin...

[COUGHING]

That's how Sokka started yesterday.

Now look at him.

He thinks he's an earthbender.

Take that, you rock.

A few more hours
and you'll be talking nonsense, too.

I'm going to find some medicine.

Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot.

Keep an eye on them, guys.

Ha ha!

You guys are killing me.

We haven't been able to pick up
the Avatar's trail since the storm,

but if we continue
heading northeast...

What do they want?

Perhaps a sporting game of Pai Sho.

The hunt for the Avatar

has been given prime importance.

All information regarding the Avatar

must be reported
directly to Admiral Zhao.

Zhao has been promoted?

Well, good for him.

I've got nothing to report to Zhao.

Now get off my ship and let us pass.

Admiral Zhao is not allowing ships

in or out of this area.

Off my ship!

Excellent.

I take the pot.

But you're all improving.

I'm certain you will win
if we play again.

It says here
that the Avatar can create tornadoes

and run faster than the wind.

Pretty amazing.

Aw, that's just a bunch
of Fire Lord propaganda.

There's no way that's true.

[BLOWS HORN]

Katara, please, water.

Listen carefully, Momo.

I need you to take this
to the river and fill it with water.

[HEARING GIBBERISH]

Got it?

Hello. I'm sorry
to barge in like this,

but I need some medicine
for my friends.

They have fevers
and they've been coughing...

Settle down, young man.

Your friends are going to be fine.

I've been up here
for over 40 years, you know.

Used to be others,
but they all left years ago.

Now it's just me and Miyuki.

That's nice.

Wounded Earth Kingdom troops
still come by now and again.

Brave boys,

and thanks to my remedies,

they always leave in better shape
than when they arrived.

That's nice. Are you almost done?

Hold on.

I just need to add
one last ingredient.

Oh, sandalwood?

Oh, yes... No, that won't do.

Banana leaf? Eh, nope.

Ginger root?

Uh-uh.

Oh, where is that pesky little plant?

Is everything OK?

It's been almost an hour

and you haven't given
the men an order.

I don't care what they do.

Don't give up hope yet.

You can still find the Avatar
before Zhao.

How, uncle?

With Zhao's resources,

it's just a matter of time

before he captures the Avatar.

My honor, my throne, my country...

I'm about to lose them all.

Oh, here's what I was looking for.

Plum blossom.

Finally. Thanks for all your help.

Hands off.

What do you think you're doing?

Taking the cure to my friends.

Oh! Ha ha! This isn't a cure.

It's Miyuki's dinner.

Plum blossom is her favorite.

What about my friends?

Well, all they need
is some frozen wood frogs.

There's plenty of them
down in the valley swamp.

What am I supposed to do
with frozen frogs?

Why, suck on them, of course.

Suck on them?

The frog skin excretes a substance

that'll cure your friends,

but make sure you get plenty.

Once those little critters thaw out,

they're useless.

You're insane, aren't you?

That's right.

Well, don't stand there all day.

Go!

Uh! Whoa!

Uh, I think you dropped this.

Aah!

A frog!

So this is the great Avatar,

master of all the elements.

I don't know how
you've managed to elude

the Fire Nation for 100 years,

but your little game
of hide and seek is over.

I've never hidden from you.

Untie me and I'll fight you right now.

Uh, no.

Tell me, how does it feel
to be the only airbender left?

Do you miss your people?

Oh, don't worry.

You won't be killed like they were.

See, if you die, you'll just be reborn

and the Fire Nation will have to begin

its search for the Avatar
all over again.

So I'll keep you alive,
but just barely.

Blow all the wind you want.

Your situation is futile.

There is no escaping this fortress

and no one is coming to rescue you.

[COUGHING]

Water.

Momo should be back any minute.

No, Momo.

Water.

Wa-ter.

Aang, what in the world
is taking you so long?

All clear.

All clear.

Go on in.

We are the sons and daughters
of fire, the superior element,

until today, only one thing
stood in our path to victory...

The Avatar!

I am here to tell you
that he is now my prisoner!

[CHEERING]

This is the year Sozin's Comet
returns to grant us its power!

[CROWD CHEERING]

This is the year the Fire Nation

breaks through
the walls of Ba Sing Se,

and burns the city to the ground.

[CHEERING]

What? No!

Don't leave, frogs. My friends
are sick and they need you.

Please go back to being frozen.

[FROGS CROAKING]

[PUNCHES BEING THROWN]

[PUNCHES BEING THROWN]

Aah!

Aah!

Who are you? What's going on?

Are you here to rescue me?

I'll take that as a yes.

My frogs!

Come back!

And stop thawing out!

Wait!

My friends need to
suck on those frogs!

How many times
do I have to tell you, Momo?

We need water.

Wa-ter.

Oh, forget it.

Aang, please hurry.

Who is this Aang kid
you keep talking about, your highness?

I want a full transcription
of my speech

sent to the Fire Lord,

Along with glowing testimonials

from all of the ranking officers
present, and...

[MEN GRUNTING]

[CROAKS]

Sir, shall I hold off
sending that speech to the Fire Lord?

[NOISY CHIMES RINGING]

There. On the wall!

Aah!

The Avatar has escaped!

Close all the gates immediately.

Stay close to me.

Aah!

Aah!

[YELLS]

Take this.

Jump on my back!

Give me the next one!

Hold your fire!

The Avatar must be captured alive.

Open the gate.

Admiral, what are you doing?

Let them out.

Now!

How could you let them go?

A situation like this requires...
Precision.

Do you have a clear shot?

Knock out the thief.

I'll deliver him to the Fire Lord
along with the Avatar.

Quick! Recover the Avatar!

[CROAKS]

You know what the worst part

about being born
over 100 years ago is?

I miss all the friends
I used to hang out with.

Before the war started,

I used to always
visit my friend, Kuzon.

The two of us, we'd get in and out

of so much trouble together.

He was one of the best friends
I ever had...

And he was from the Fire Nation,
just like you.

If we knew each other back then,

do you think
we could have been friends, too?

Where have you been, Prince Zuko?

You missed music night.

Lieutenant Jee sang
a stirring love song.

I'm going to bed.

No disturbances.

[PLAYING INSTRUMENT]

Suck on these.

It'll make you feel better.

Aang, how was your trip?

Did you make any new friends?

No.

I don't think I did.

Mm!

This is tasty.

Mm, mm!

[CROAKS]

Ptooey!

Aah!

Look!

He is taunting us.

You are so going to be dinner.

Hey, where's the fishing line?

Oh, I didn't think
you would need it, Sokka.

Ah, it's all tangled.

Not tangled, woven.

I made you a necklace, Katara.

I thought since you lost
your other one...

Thanks, Aang.


 


I love it.

Great, Aang.

Maybe instead of saving the world,

you can go
into the jewelry-making business.

I don't see why I can't do both.

Huh!

Stop taunting me!

Uhh!

KATARA: So, how do I look?

You mean, all of you
or just your neck...

I mean, because they both look great.

Smoochie smoochie.

Someone's in love.

I, well...

Stop teasing him, Sokka.

Aang's just a good friend,

a sweet little guy, just like Momo.

Thanks.

[GROWLING]

Someone's being attacked
by a platypus bear!

Well, hello there.

Nice day, isn't it?

Make noise! He'll run off!

No, play dead! He'll lose interest!

Whoa, close one. Ha ha ha.

Run downhill, then climb a tree!

No, punch him in the bill!

And then run in zig-zags.

No need.

It's going to be fine.

Whoa, there.

[ROARS]

Mmm, lunch.

[SNIFFS]

Lucky for you we came along.

Thanks, but everything
was already under control.

Not to worry.

Aunt Wu predicted
I'd have a safe journey.

Aunt who?

No, Aunt Wu.

She's the fortune-teller
from my village.

Awful nice knowing your future.

Wow, it must be.

That explains why you were so calm.

But the fortune-teller was wrong.

You didn't have a safe journey.

You were almost killed.

But I wasn't.

All right, have a good one.

Oh, and Aunt Wu said if I met
any travelers, to give them this.

Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu
and learn our fortunes.

It could be fun.

Oh, come on.
Fortune-telling is nonsense.

What do you know?

An umbrella.

[THUNDER]

That proves it.

No, it doesn't.

You can't really tell the future.

I guess you're not
really getting wet, then.

Whoa... Aah!

Of course she predicted

it was gonna rain.

The sky has been gray all day.

Just admit you might be wrong,

and you can come under the umbrella.

Look, I'm gonna
predict the future now.

It's going to keep drizzling.

See?

Not everyone has the gift, Sokka.

Aah!

[QUACKING]

Aunt Wu is expecting you.

Really?

Pfft.

My name is Meng,
and I'm Aunt Wu's assistant.

Well, hello there.

Hello.

Can I get you some tea

or some of Aunt Wu's
special bean curd puffs?

I'll try a curd puff.

Just a second.

So, what's your name?

Aang.

That rhymes with Meng,

and you've got some pretty big ears,
don't you?

I guess.

Don't be modest.

They're huge.

Well, Aang, it's very nice
to meet you...

Very nice.

Likewise.

I can't believe we're here

in the house of nonsense.

Try to keep an open mind, Sokka.

There are things in this world

that just can't be explained.

Wouldn't it be nice to have
some insight into your future?

It would be nice
to have some bean curd puffs.

Oh, Meng!

Aunt Wu says
I'm going to meet my true love!

He's going to give me
a rare panda lily.

That's so romantic.

I wonder if my true love
will give me a rare flower.

Good luck with that.

[CHUCKLE]

Is that the big-eared guy
who Aunt Wu predicted you'd marry?

Aah!

Enjoy your snack.

Welcome, young travelers.

Now, who's next?

Don't be shy.

I guess that's me.

Not bad, not bad.

Mmm! Mmm!

Hmm?

I'm good on puffs.

Hmm.

So, what do you think
they're talking about back there?

Boring stuff, I'm sure.

Love, who she's gonna marry,

how many babies she's gonna have.

Yeah, dumb stuff like that.

Well, I gotta find a bathroom.

AUNT WU: Your palms are so smooth.

Do you use moisturizer?

KATARA: Actually,
I have this special seaweed lotion.

I could get you some if you want.

So, do you see anything
interesting in my love line?

I see a great romance for you...

The man you're going to marry.

Tell me more!

I can see
that he's a very powerful bender.

Looks like someone
had a pretty good bathroom break.

Yeah, when I was in there...

I don't even want to know.

Who's next?

OK, let's get this over with.

Your future is full
of struggle and anguish,

most of it self-inflicted.

But you didn't read
my palms or anything.

I don't need to.

It's written all over your face.

You there, come with me.

This is the most reliable method
of telling your fortune.

The bones never lie.

Go on. Pick one.

Now throw it on the fire.

The heat makes cracks in the bones,

and I read the bone cracks
to tell your destiny.

AANG: Wow, that's a big crack.

I've never seen this before.

[GASPS]

Oh, my!

Your destiny... This is incredible.

You will be involved
in a great battle...

An awesome conflict
between the forces of good and evil.

A battle whose outcome will determine
the fate of the whole world.

Yeah, yeah. I knew that already,

But did it say anything about a girl?

A girl?

You want to know about love?

Yes!

I'm sorry, but I didn't see anything.

Oh, look!

I must have missed something.

Right here.

It says, "trust your heart, and you
will be with the one you love."

Really?

Thank you, Aunt Wu!

SOKKA: Well, now you got to see
for yourselves

that fortune-telling
is just a big, stupid hoax.

You're just saying that

because you're gonna make yourself
unhappy your whole life.

That woman is crazy!

My life will be calm and happy
and joyful!

Ow!

That doesn't prove anything.

Well, I liked my predictions.

Certain things
are gonna turn out very well.

They sure are.

Why?

What did she tell you?

Some stuff.

You'll find out.

What's with the sky?

We're waiting for Aunt Wu
to come and read the clouds

to predict the fate
of the whole village.

That cloud kind of looks
like a fluffy bunny.

You better hope that's not a bunny.

The fluffy bunny cloud
forecasts doom and destruction.

Do you even hear yourself?

The cloud reading
will tell us if Mount Makapu

will remain dormant for another year

or if it will erupt.

We used to have
a tradition once a year

of going up the mountain

to check the volcano ourselves,

But ever since Aunt Wu

moved to the village 20 years ago,

we have a tradition of not doing that.

I can't believe
you would trust your lives

to that crazy
old woman's superstition!

Shh! She's coming.

[CHEERING]

Hey, Aang,

don't you think that cloud
looks like a flower, huh?

Sure, I guess.

Hey, Katara, don't you think
that cloud looks like a flower?

Shh!

Bending arrow cloud...

Good crops this year.
Nice, big harvest.

Darn good news!

Wavy moon-shaped cloud... Let's see.

Gonna be a great year for twins.

-Yes!
-Yes!

And a cumulus cloud with a twisty
nub coming off the end of it...

The village will not be destroyed
by the volcano this year!

[CHEERING]

Since I got you here,

there's something I want to tell you.

I like you, but more than normal.

Never mind.

Hi, Aunt Wu.

Sorry to bother you.

Anytime.

About this man I'm supposed to marry...

Is he gonna be handsome?

Oh, I hope he's tall.

Ah. You want another reading.

Yes, please.

I can't believe all these saps.

Someone really needs
to scream some sense at them.

They seem happy, Sokka.

Not for long.

I'm gonna prove
Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense.

Hey, you,

I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear
those red shoes, didn't she?

Yeah, she said
I'd be wearing red shoes

when I met my true love.

Uh-huh.

And how many times
have you worn those shoes

since you got that fortune?

Every day.

Then of course it's gonna come true!

Really? You think so?

I'm so excited!

Uhh!

[SQUAWKING]

Aah! Uhh!

And then you'll have
your third great grandchild

before quietly
passing away in your sleep.

Is that enough information for you?

Wow. Thanks, Aunt Wu.

Oh, wait. One more thing.

How warmly should I dress tomorrow?

You want me to do a reading for that?

I don't care what Aunt Wu told you!

You have to take a bath sometime!

[CHUCKLING]

So, Sokka, you know some stuff
about ladies, right?

Some stuff?

You've come to the right place.

What can I do you for?

Well, there's this girl...

[GIGGLING]

I think I know who you mean.

You do? And you're OK with it?

Of course I am.

And to tell you the truth,

I've been picking up
a subtle vibe that she likes you, too.

She does?

Oh, yeah. She's crazy about you.

All you have to do now
is not mess it up.

Well, how do I do that?

The number one mistake
nice guys like you make...

Being too nice.

You can be too nice?

Yep. If you want to
keep her interested,

you have to act aloof,

Like you don't really care
one way or the other.

Well, OK.

Hey, Aang. I was wondering...

See you later.

Hmm.

Wow. That kid is good.

And you'll be fine
as long as you've got a scarf.

Bye-bye, now.

OK, OK. But one more thing.

All right. What is it?

Should I eat a mango or a papaya

for breakfast tomorrow?

Papaya.

Oh, I hate papaya.

Oh. Hey, Katara.

I didn't see you there.

Hey, Aang.

That's OK.

I'm busy with my own stuff.

[QUACK]

Ugh. Papaya, please.

So, papaya.

Uh-huh. Would you like some?

You know me.

I don't really care what I eat.

OK, then.

See you later.

Ugh!

Maybe aloof isn't my style.

Oh, a panda lily.

Did you see that?

Excuse me. Where can a guy
find one of those things?

SOKKA: I can't believe you're
dragging me all the way up here

For a stupid flower.

Not just any flower... A panda lily.

I've seen it in action,
and, boy, does it work.

Flowers are fine once you're married,

but at this early stage,

it's critical that you maintain
maximum aloofness.

But my heart
is telling me to get this flower,

And Aunt Wu said
if I trusted my heart,

I would be with the one I love.

What? Don't tell me
you believe in that stuff, too.

Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet.

Why should she be wrong about love?

There, on the rim!

[GASP]

Oh, no.

Aunt Wu was wrong.

Those people all think they're safe.

We've got to warn them.

There's no time to walk.

Grab on.

Aah!

Hi, Katara.

Can you believe she won't let me in?

And after all the business
I've given her?

But she doesn't even charge.

I know, but still.

Well, we have other things
to worry about.

Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano.

Sokka, you tried to convince me
she was wrong before.

It's gonna take an awful lot
to change my...

[RUMBLING]

Oh, no.

SOKKA: Everyone, that volcano
is gonna blow any second!

Aunt Wu was wrong!

Yeah, yeah. We know
you don't believe in Aunt Wu,

Mr. Science and Reason lover.

If you won't listen to him,
maybe you'll listen to me.

I want to believe Aunt Wu and her
predictions as much as you do,

but my brother and Aang saw the lava

with their own eyes.

Well, I heard Aunt Wu's prediction
with my own ears.

Please listen to us!

You are all in danger,

and we have to get out of here!

You can't rely
on Aunt Wu's predictions!

You have to take fate
into your own hands!

Look!

Can your fortune-telling explain that?

Heh. Can your science
explain why it rains?

Yes! Yes, it can!

They just won't listen to reason.

But they will listen to Aunt Wu.

I know. That's the problem.

Well, it's about to become
the solution.

We're taking fate in our own hands.

First, I need to borrow
Aunt Wu's cloud-reading book.

[CHATTERS] Shh.

We don't want anyone to hear us.

Oh! Oh, I didn't see you there.

You don't like me, do you?

Of course I like you.

But not the way I like you.

Oh. I guess not.

It's OK.

It's just really hard
when you like someone,

but they don't think of you that way.

I know what you mean.

She's beautiful, by the way.

Huh?

That water tribe girl.

I can see why you like her so much.

She's sweet, she's a bender,

and her hair seems so manageable.

Don't worry.

You're gonna meet a great guy

who's gonna completely fall for you.

I know it.

Thanks.

Wait.

Don't you want this?

How did you know?

I've kind of been stalking you. Heh.

Oh, thanks...

I guess.

[GRUMBLING]

AANG: Clouds are made
of water and air,

So between the two of us,

we ought to be able to bend them
into any shape we want.

I found it...
The symbol for volcanic doom.

[GRUMBLING]

SOKKA: Aunt Wu, look!

Something's happening in the clouds!

That's very strange.

It shouldn't... Oh, my!

AANG: We could still save the village
if we act fast.

Sokka has a plan.

Lava is gonna flow
downhill to this spot.

If we can dig a deep enough trench,

we can channel all the lava
away from the village

to the river.

If any of you are earth benders,
come with me.

I'm an earth bender!

I'm not!

Everybody else, grab a shovel.

[CROWD GASPS]

Come on! We've got to hurry.

[SHOUTING]

[GASP]

Dig faster! Dig faster!

Everyone needs to evacuate!

We'll come for you when it's safe!

[CHATTERS]

KATARA: It's too much.

It's gonna overflow!

Aah!

Uhh!

Aah!

Man...

Sometimes I forget
what a powerful bender that kid is.

Wait, what did you just say?

Nothing. Just that Aang
is one powerful bender.

I suppose he is.

AANG: By the way,
we kind of borrowed your book.

So you messed with the clouds,
did you?

Ha ha ha! Very clever.

No offense, but I hope this
has taught everyone a lesson

about not relying too much
on fortune-telling.

But Aunt Wu predicted
the village wouldn't be destroyed,

and it wasn't.

She was right, after all.

I hate you.

It's OK, Sokka.

Everything's gonna be all right.

Can I ask you something?

Of course, honey.

You didn't really see love
in my fortune, did you?

You just told me
what I wanted to hear.

I'll tell you a little secret,
young airbender.

Just as you reshaped those clouds,

you have the power
to shape your own destiny.

KATARA: Good-bye, everyone!

It was so nice to meet you!

Take care, Meng.

Take care!

Floozy.

Hey, look!
A sword made out of a whale's tooth!

Let me see that.

This is a Water Tribe weapon.

See if you can find anything else.

Did someone lose something?

No, we found something.

It's burned.

There was a battle.

Water Tribe warriors ambushed
a group of firebenders.


 


The firebenders fought back,

but the warriors
drove them down this hill.

So then what happened?

I don't know. The trail ends here.

Wait! Look!

It's one of our boats!

KATARA: Is this dad's boat?

No, but it's from his fleet.

Dad was here.

Ahh!

See, Prince Zuko?

A moment of quiet is good
for your mental well-being.

-[THUDDING]
-Unh!

[GRUMBLES]

-Watch out!
-[GROWLING]

Get back!

We're after a stowaway.

There are no stowaways on my ship.

[SNARLING]

[PANTING]

He's paralyzed.

Only temporarily.

The toxins will wear off
in about an hour.

But by then, he'll be in jail,

and I'll have my money.

But how did you find him on my ship?

My shirshu can smell a rat
a continent away.

Well, I'm impressed.

Very impressed.

Sokka.

I'm coming with you.

You're not old enough to go to war,
Sokka. You know that.

I'm strong. I'm brave.

I can fight!

Please, dad?

Being a man is knowing
where you're needed the most,

and for you right now,
that's here protecting your sister.

I don't understand.

Someday you will.

I'm gonna miss you so much.

[SOBBING]

Who's there?

Sokka?

Bato?

Who the what now?

Bato!

Sokka! Katara!

It is so good to see you two.

Oh. You've grown so much.

Hi, I'm Aang.

-Where's dad?
-Is he here?

No. He and the other warriors

should be in the eastern
Earth Kingdom by now.

[WIND BLOWING]

[SHUDDERS]

This is no place for a reunion.

Let's get inside.

After I was wounded,

your father carried me to this abbey.

The sisters
have cared for me ever since.

Superior, these are Hakoda's children.

They've been traveling
with the Avatar.

I found them by my boat.

Young Avatar, it gives me great joy

to be in your presence.

Welcome to our abbey.

Thank you.
It's truly an honor to be here.

If there's anything...

What smells so good, Bato?

[SNIFFING]

The sisters craft ointments
and perfumes.

Perfume? Maybe we could
dump some on Appa,

because he stinks so much.

Am I right?

[PERSON COUGHS]

You have your father's wit.

Bato, it looks like home!

Everything's here, even the pelts.

Yeah. Nothing's cozier
than dead animal skins.

Ack!

No way! Stewed sea prunes?

Help yourself.

Dad could eat
a whole barrel of these things.

[SNIFFS] Ugh!

Bato, is it true you
and dad lassoed an arctic hippo?

It was your father's idea.

He just dragged me along.

Well, the hippo did the dragging.

Hey, I ride animals, too!

One time, there was
this giant eel, and I...

So, who was it that came up
with the great blubber fiasco?

You knew about that?

Everyone does.

What's that story?

It's a long one, Aang.

Some other time.

You and dad had
so many hilarious adventures.

Not all of which
were hilarious at the time,

but everything's funny with hindsight.

Aang!

Please put that down.
It's ceremonial and very fragile.

SOKKA: Was it you or dad
that put an octopus on your head

and convinced gran-gran
you were a water spirit?

Your dad wore the octopus,
but I did the spooky voice.

[PEOPLE CHEERING]

MAN: Aah! Unh...

[GRUNTING]

Out of my way! Step aside, filth.

He means no offense.

I'm certain you bathe regularly.

I need to talk to you.

Well, if it isn't my new friends,

Angry Boy and Uncle Lazy.

Heh heh heh!

[CHEERING]

Your beast trashed my ship.

You have to pay me back.

Well, I'd love to help you out,

but I'm a little short on money.

Drinks on me!

[CHEERING AND SHOUTING]

Money isn't what I had in mind.

I need you to find someone.

What happened?
Your girlfriend run off on you?

It's not the girl I'm after.

It's the bald monk
she's traveling with.

Whatever you say.

If you find them,

I'll consider the damage
to my ship paid for.

Ha! Forget it.

Plus, we'll pay your weight in gold.

Make it your weight,
and we got a deal.

Ha ha ha! You got it!

Get on!

BATO: There's something
I should tell you kids.

I'm expecting a message
from your father.

-Really?
-When?

Any day now.

Your father said he'd send a message

when they found the rendezvous point.

If you wait here
until the message arrives,

you can come with me
and see your father again.

It's been over two years
since we've seen dad.

That would be so incredible.

Katara!

KATARA: I do really miss him.

It would be great to see dad.

BATO: It's been far too long,
hasn't it?

I'm not sure when word will arrive,

but when it does...

It would be great, but we can't.

We have to take Aang
to the North Pole first.

Even if we had time
to wait for the message,

who knows how far we'd have to travel?

We don't have time for a long detour.

I'm sure your father would understand,

and be proud that his children
are helping the Avatar.

I can't believe they would leave me.

[ANIMAL NEIGHING]

I'm looking for Bato
of the Water Tribe.

Uh, I know Bato.

Make sure he gets this.

It's the map
to Sokka and Katara's dad.

Hey, everyone.

Sorry I was gone so long.

Hey, Aang. I didn't notice you left.

Yep. But now I'm back.

Sure could go for some
delicious sea prunes.

Mmm! Yum yum! Mmm!

[CHOKES]

Mmm!

[ROARING]

Out for a bit of fresh air, are we?

ZUKO: We're looking for someone.

I hope it's not Miyuki.

Miyuki, did you get in trouble
with the Fire Nation again?

[MEOWS]

The Avatar's been through here.

Let's keep moving.

Aha! I caught you.

You should be ashamed of yourself.

Littering in the courtyard.

I'm sorry. I'll take care of this.

BATO: This ship is sentimental to me.

It was built by my father.

[WHISTLING]

SOKKA: Is this the boat
he took you ice dodging in?

BATO: Yep, and it's got
the scar to prove it.

Ha! How about you, Sokka?

You must have some good stories
from your first time ice dodging.

He never got to go.

Dad left before he was old enough.

Oh, I forgot. You were too young.

What's ice dodging?

It's a rite of passage
for young Water Tribe members.

When you turn 14, your dad takes you...

You know what?

You're about to find out.

[SCREAMING]

ZUKO: Why are we stopping?

Because the girl must have
spent a lot of time here.

We have no time for this.

Hey, watch it!

-Heh heh heh!
-Oh, look. He likes you.

Care to hear your fortune, handsome?

At my age, there's really
only one big surprise left,

and I'd just as soon
leave it a mystery.

[SNARLING]

BATO: Ice dodging is a ceremonial test

of wisdom, bravery, and trust.

In our village,
it was done by weaving a boat

through a field of icebergs.

How are we supposed
to ice dodge without ice?

You'll be dodging... Those.

Sokka, you steer and call the shots.

Lead wisely.

Katara, you secure the mainsail.

The winds can be brutal. So be brave.

Aang, you control the jib.

Without your steady hand,
we all go down.

Your position is about trust.

I know that! Why wouldn't I know that?

I'm the Avatar! I know about trust.

For this to be done right,
I cannot help.

You pass or fail on your own.

Aang, ease up on the jib.

Katara, steady.

Aang, less sail.

Unh! Katara, give him room.

Unh!

Aang, helm to lee. Helm to lee!

What does that even mean?

SOKKA: [GRUNTS]

[STRAINING]

Great job!

There's no way through!

We can make it!

Sokka, you've already proven yourself.
Maybe we should...

Aang! I'm gonna need air in that sail!

Katara, I want you to bend
as much water as you can

between us and those rocks.

Now!

[GROANS]

[SIGHS]

The spirits of water bear witness
to these marks.

For Sokka, the mark of the wise...

The same mark your father earned.

For Katara, the mark of the brave.

Your courage inspires us.

And for Aang, the mark of the trusted.

You are now an honorary member
of the Water Tribe.

I can't.

Of course you can.

No. You can't trust me.

Aang, what are you talking about?

A messenger gave this to me for Bato.

You have to understand.
I was afraid you wouldn't...

This is the map to our father!

You had it the whole time?

How could you?

Well, you can go to
the North Pole on your own.

I'm going to find dad.

BATO: Now, Sokka, I think you should...

Katara, are you with me?

I'm with you, Sokka.

Good luck.

Okay. You too.

Guess I should be moving on.

That would be best.

I'm an idiot, Momo.

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

[ROARING]

We're getting close.

[WOLF HOWLING]

That wolf sounds so sad.

It's probably wounded.

No. It's been separated from the pack.

I understand that pain.

It's how I felt when
the Water Tribe warriors

had to leave me behind.

They were my family,

and being apart from them
was more painful than my wounds.

Sokka?

We need to go back.

I want to see dad,

but helping Aang is where
we're needed the most.

You're right.

Your father will understand,

and I know he's proud of you.

Thanks, Bato.

I know where to go from here.

Take this in case you want to find us.

I'll leave a message
at the rendezvous point.

Looks like we're going alone, guys.

Avatar! You must leave.

Okay, I get it.
Everybody wants me gone.

A group of people came to the abbey
looking for you.

Who?

A fierce-looking woman
with a horrible monster,

and a young man with a scar.

Zuko.

The beast was using the scent
of a necklace to follow you.

A necklace?

[GASPS] Katara!

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

[ROARING]

So this is your girlfriend.

No wonder she left.

She's way too pretty for you.

Where is he? Where's the Avatar?

We split up. He's long gone.

How stupid do you think I am?

Pretty stupid. Run!

BOTH: Aah! Unh!

ZUKO: What are we supposed to do now?

It's seeking a different scent,

perhaps something
that the Avatar held.

[SNIFFING]

[SCREAMING]

ZUKO: What's it doing?

It's just going in a circle.

[ALL YELLING]

-Aang!
-Up!

[GROWLING]

Hah!

Aargh!

-Aah!
-Unh!

Oof!

Unh!

Come on, get up!

[GROWLING]

Unh!

[GROANS]

[GASPS]

Aah!

I'm starting to get some feeling back.

Ow...

[SNIFFS]

Ahh...

You've got something I want.

Aah!

Unh!

Oof!

[SNIFFS] Ugh.

[SNIFFS]

That thing sees with its nose.

Let's give him something to look at.

The perfume?

Ohh!

June, no!

Uncle?

I didn't see you get hit
with the tongue.

Shh...

So... Where do we go?

We're getting you to the North Pole.

Yeah. We've lost
too much time as it is.

Don't you want to see your father?

Of course we do, Aang,

but you're our family, too,

and right now, you need us more.

And we need you.

I wish I could give you
a little piece of home, Katara,

something to remind you...

-I'll be okay.
-Still, just a little trinket.

Maybe something like... This?

Aang! How'd you get that?

Zuko asked me
to be sure I got it to you.

Oh, that's so sweet of Zuko.

Would you give him a kiss for me
when you see him?

Sure.

Mwah.

[CLOSING THEME PLAYING]

This should give us a good idea
of what's around here.

See if you can find a menu.

I'm starving.

I bet we'll find something
to eat here...

The Fire Days Festival.

Fire Nation cultural exhibits,

jugglers, benders, magicians...

This would be a great place for me
to study some real firebenders.


 


You might want to rethink that.

Look at this.

AANG: Hey, a poster of me!

A wanted poster.

This is bad.

I think we better keep moving.

I have to learn firebending
at some point,

and this could be my only chance
to watch some masters up close.

I guess we could go check it out.

What?

You want to walk into
a Fire Nation town

when they're all fired up
with all their, you know, fire?

We'll wear disguises.

And if it looks like trouble,
we'll leave.

Yeah.

Because we always leave
before we get into trouble.

[GROWLING]

You guys stay out of sight here
while we go to the festival.

[COOING]

Ready disguises.

It's like you're a whole
different person.

Let's go!

Ha ha ha ha!

KATARA: I think we need
some new disguises.

Where are we gonna get
masks like that?

Get your genuine
Fire-Festival masks here!

That was surprisingly easy.

Hey, there's some food.

Finally!

What do you have?

Flaming fire flakes.

Best in town.

I'll take 'em.

Mmm! Mmm!

[SCREAMING]

Oh, hot, hot!

Flaming fire flakes, hot.

What do you know?

Hey, look at this!

Don't worry, loyal citizens,

no one can surprise the Fire Lord!

-Oh, no!
-Look out!

[CHEERING]

KATARA: Aang, hold on.

Where are we going?

I don't know...

But there's a big crowd,
so it must be good.

SOKKA: Knowing the Fire Nation,

it's probably an execution.

[APPLAUSE]

I gotta learn that trick.

Thank you!

For my next trick,

I need a volunteer from the audience.

Ooh, ooh! Me! me!

What do you think you're doing?

I want to get a closer look.

It's better that we don't attract
any attention to ourselves.

How about you, little lady?

Uh...

Aw, she's shy.

Let's give her some
encouragement, folks.

[CHEERING]

Aw, that could have been me.

This next trick is called
Taming the Dragon!

You will be my captured princess.

Don't worry, young maiden!

I will tame this fiery beast!

It's too strong!

I can't hold it!

We gotta help her!

No, we don't want to make a scene.

The rope... It's breaking!

[SCREAMS]

Hey, you trying to upstage me, kid?

[BOOING]

MAN: Hey! That kid's the Avatar!

I think it's time to go.

MAN: Follow me!

I can get you out of here!

GUARD: There they are!

Over there!

I'm calling Appa.

SOKKA: I hope he can really hear
that bison whistle!

MAN: This way!

OK, not this way.

[MEN COUGHING]

Huh?

[GROWLS]

AANG: Appa, down here!

[GROWLS]

[CHEERING]

Beautiful!

[LAUGHTER]

Nice touch setting off the fireworks.

You seem to really know
your explosives.

I'm familiar.

You're a Fire Nation soldier.

Was.

My name's Chey.

CHEY: I serve a man...

More than a man, really,

he's a myth...

But he's real, a living legend...

Jeong Jeong the Deserter.

He was a Fire Nation general.

Or wait... Was he an admiral?

He was very highly ranked. We get it.

Yeah! Way up there!

But he couldn't take
the madness anymore.

He's the first person ever
to leave the army and live.

I'm the second, but you don't
get to be a legend for that.

It's OK, though.

Jeong Jeong's a firebending genius.

Some say he's mad,

but he's not.

He's enlightened.

You mean there's a firebender out here

who's not with the Fire Lord?

We've gotta go see him!

He can train me!

We're not gonna go find
some crazy firebender.

CHEY: He's not crazy!

He's a genius!

And he's the perfect person
to train the Avatar.

That's why I followed you
into the festival.

Look, thanks for the help,

but we're leaving for the North Pole
in the morning.

Sokka, this could be my only chance
to meet a firebending master

who would actually be willing
to teach me.

It can't hurt just to talk to him.

That's what you said about
going to the festival!

Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me?

[GASPS]

Aagh!

[GASPS]

Don't move.

[LOWING]

Jeong Jeong told you
not to look for Avatar.

Hold on. You know these guys?

Oh, yeah.

Lin Ye's an old buddy.

Right, Lin Ye?

Shut up. Keep moving.

[COOING]

LIN YE: Go on. He sees you only.

Oh, that's OK.

We can chat later.

Is that where Jeong Jeong is?

I need to talk to him right away.

No. You wait there.

Go, now!

Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

He's a great man.

A great man!

ZHAO: So, the Avatar was here

and you let him slip away?

Yes, sir.

But other than that,
the festival went off without a hitch.

[GRUNTS]

No fights. Theft was way down.

I don't care
about your local crime rates!

Which way did they go?

They headed into the forest.

Up the river, I suspect.

Ready the riverboats.

We're going after the Avatar.

What happened?
Can I see Jeong Jeong now?

He won't see you.

He's very angry
that I brought you here.

He wants you to leave immediately.

Finally! Let's hit the road.

Why won't he see me?

He says you're not ready.

Says you haven't mastered
waterbending and earthbending yet.

Wait, how does he know that?

He saw the way you walked into camp.

He can tell.

I'm going in anyway.

[INHALES]

Get out!

Master, I need to learn firebending.

Only a fool seeks his own destruction.

I am the Avatar.

-It's my destiny to...
-Destiny?

What would a boy know of destiny?

If a fish lives its whole life
in this river,

does he know the river's destiny?

No!

Only that it runs on and on
out of his control.

He may follow where it flows,

but he cannot see the end.

He cannot imagine the ocean.

OK...

But it's the Avatar's duty

to master all of
the bending disciplines.

To master the bending disciplines,

you must first master
discipline itself.

But you have no interest in this,

so I have no interest in you.

Now, get out.

Please, I have to learn.

This could be my only chance.

Are you deaf?

How can I teach you
if you refuse to listen?

Before learning firebending,

you must learn water and earth.

Water is cool and soothing.

Earth is steady and stable.

But fire...

Fire is alive.

It breathes, it grows.

Without the bender,
a rock will not throw itself.

But fire will spread

and destroy everything in its path

if one does not have
the will to control it!

That is its destiny.

You are not ready!

You are too weak!

You think I am weak?

Avatar Roku!

No, no!

I did not mean that.

I have mastered the elements

a thousand times
in a thousand lifetimes.

Now, I must do it once again.

You will teach the Avatar firebending.

Yes, yes.

I will teach you.

AANG: Really?

That's great!

[GROANS]

Widen your stance.

Wider!

Bend your knees.

Now, concentrate.

Good. Good!

Wait. What do I do now?

Silence! Talking is not concentrating.

Look at your friend. Is she talking?

Even that oaf knows to concentrate
on what he's doing.

SOKKA: Hey!

But what am I concentrating on?

Feel the heat of the sun.

It is the greatest source of fire,

yet it is in complete balance
with nature.

So, when do I get to make some fire?

Concentrate!

[SIGHS]

[LAUGHTER]

Are we coming up here
so I don't burn anything

with my fire blasts?

No fire yet.

What?

Power in firebending
comes from the breath.

That is why you must master
proper breath control.

You brought me up here to breathe?

Assume your stance.

Wider.

-You're not even look...
-Wider!

Now, inhale through the nose
and exhale through the mouth...

Without talking.

[INHALES]

[EXHALES]

Good. Keep going.

[INHALES]

[EXHALES]

[INHALES]

[EXHALES]

JEONG JEONG: What are you doing here?

I did not tell you to stop!

I've been breathing for hours.

You want to stop breathing?

I want you to stop wasting my time.

I already know
how to squat and breathe

and feel the sun.

I want to know how to shoot fire
out of my fingertips.

[SIGHS]

I had a pupil once

who had no interest
in learning discipline.

He was only concerned
with the power of fire...

How he could use it
to destroy his opponents

and wipe out the obstacles
in his path,

but fire is a horrible burden to bear.

Its nature is to consume,

and without control,
it destroys everything around it.

[GRUNTS]

JEONG JEONG: Learn restraint,

or risk destroying yourself
and everything you love.

I thought about what you said.

I promise I'll be more patient.

We're going to work with fire now.

Oh, yeah!

I mean...

Let us begin.

Concentrate on the fire.

I want you to keep this flame
from reaching the edges of the leaf

for as long as you can.

[GROANS]

GUARD: Master, there is trouble!

What's going on?!

Concentrate on your leaf.

This is the worst
firebending instruction ever.

All he does
is leave me alone for hours

to concentrate or breathe.

I'm sure there's a good reason.

But I'm ready to do so much more.

[EXHALES]

[INHALES]

[EXHALES]

I did it. I made fire!

Aang, that's great.

But you should take it slow.

-Whoa!
-Careful!

Aagh!

Now, that's firebending.

Aang, you'll hurt yourself.

I wonder how that juggler did it.

[SCREAMS]

Katara!

I'm so sorry!

[WEEPING]

Katara, what's wrong?

What did you do?

It was an accident!

I was... Uh! Katara, I'm so...

[GRUNTS]

I told you we shouldn't
mess around with this!

Look what you did!

You burned my sister!

[SOBBING]

You burned my sister!

This is all your fault!

I know! Now, pack your things.

You must leave immediately.

I'm sorry.

I didn't...

I'm sorry!

[WEEPING]

[GRUNTING]

JEONG JEONG:
You have healing abilities.

The great benders of the Water Tribes
sometimes have this ability.

I've always wished
I were blessed like you...

Free from this burning curse.

But you're a great master.

You have powers I'll never know.

Water brings healing and life.

But fire brings only destruction
and pain.

It forces those of us
burdened with its care

to walk a razor's edge
between humanity and savagery.

Eventually we're torn apart.

Go get your friends and flee!

Do not come back here
or you will all be destroyed!

Hurry!

Don't worry, men.

My old teacher gave up fighting
a long time ago...

Haven't you, Master Jeong Jeong?

Katara, are you all right?

I'm fine.

We've gotta get out of here.

Where's Aang?

Jeong Jeong tried to tell me
that I wasn't ready.

I wouldn't listen.

I'm never gonna firebend again.

KATARA: You'll have to eventually.

No, never again.

It's OK, Aang. I'm healed.

What? How?

I'll explain later.

But, right now,
we have to get out of here.

Zhao and his soldiers are attacking.

Where?

By the river.

They captured Jeong Jeong.

I have to help him!

ZHAO: Look at you.

You were once so great.

I can't believe my former master

has become nothing more
than a simple savage.

It is you who have embraced
savagery, Zhao.

It's Admiral Zhao now.

That title will not help you
against the Avatar.

Do not try to fight him.

You are no match.

I think I can handle a child.

I have never seen such raw power.

[GROWLS]

AANG: Jeong Jeong!

We'll see.

Men, take The Deserter.

ZHAO: It's a trick!

He's run off into the woods.

Find him!

Let's find out what my old master
has taught you.

You were Jeong Jeong's student?

Until I got bored.

[GRUNTING]

[GASPS]

I see he taught you
how to duck and run like a coward,

but I doubt he showed you
what a firebender is truly capable of!

[GROWLS]

Whoa! Wild shot!

I'll show you wild! [GRUNTS]

No self-control.

ZHAO: Stand and fight, Avatar!

Oh, were we fighting?

I thought you were
just getting warmed up.

I was.

Is that all you got?

Man, they'll make anyone
an admiral these days.

[GROWLING]

Ahoy!

I'm Admiral Zhao.

[GROWLS]

I don't know why, but I thought
you'd be better than Zuko.

Aagh!

Sloppy.

-Very sloppy.
-[GRUNTS]

Nowhere to run now,

you little smart mouth.

You've lost this battle.

Are you crazy?

You haven't thrown a single blow.

No, but you have.

Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint.

[SCREAMS]

Have a nice walk home!

SOKKA: Aang, come on!

Let's go!

Wait! Where's Jeong Jeong?

He disappeared.

They all did.

Hey, where'd everybody go?

Very funny, guys!

[LOWING]

Aang, you're burned.

Let me help you.

[INHALES]

[EXHALES]

Wow! That's good water.

When did you learn how to do that?

I guess I always knew.

Oh. Well, then,

thanks for all the first aid
over the years...

Like, when I fell into
the greaseberry bramble,

and that time I had two fishhooks
in my thumb!

Two?

He tried to get the first fishhook out
with another fishhook.

SOKKA: Oh, and the time
that mink snake bit me.

Thanks for healing that up.

That's great. Really helpful.

So, travelers,
the next time you think you hear

a strange large bird talking,

take a closer look. It might not be
a giant parrot, but a flying man,

a member of a secret group
of airwalkers who laugh at gravity

and laugh at those
bound to the earth by it.

[MOMO COOING]

Aren't airbender stories the best?

Was it realistic?
Is that how it was back then?

I laugh at gravity all the time.

Ha ha! Gravity.

Jingle, jingle.

Sorry.

Aw. Cheapskates.


 


Hey, thanks for the story.

Tell it to the cap, boy.

Aw. Much obliged, little bat thing.

It means a lot
to hear airbender stories.

It must have been a hundred years ago

your great-grandpa met them.

What are you prattling about, child?

Great-grandpappy
saw the airwalkers last week.

[GREAT-GRANDPA SPEAKS HOARSELY]

AANG: We're almost
to the Northern Air Temple.

This is where
they had the championships

for sky bison polo.

Do you think
we'll really find airbenders?

You want me to be like you
or totally honest?

Are you saying I'm a liar?

I'm saying you're an optimist.
Same thing, basically.

Hey, guys, look at this!

They really are airbenders!

No, they're not.

What do you mean, they're not?

Those guys are flying!

Gliding maybe, but not flying.

You can tell by the way they move

they're not airbending.
Those people have no spirit.

Oh! Oh!

[BOY CHUCKLING]

I don't know, Aang.
That kid seemed pretty spirited.

Ow!

We'd better find some solid ground
before it finds us.

Ha ha!

Go, Teo!

Show that bald kid how it's done!

Hey there. You're pretty good.

Yeah, I know.
But I can do more than fancy gliding.

Wow! I don't think I can do that.

But here's a good one.

[KIDS CHEERING]

What do you think?

It's great.

Hey, you're a real airbender.

You must be the Avatar.

That's amazing!
I've heard stories about you.

Thanks.

Wow! This glider chair is incredible.

If you think this is good,
wait until you see

the other stuff my dad designed.

Wow!

Yeah, my dad is the mastermind

behind this whole place.

Everything is powered by hot air.

It even pumps hot air currents outside

to give us a lift when we're gliding.

This place is unbelievable.

Yeah. It's great, isn't it?

No. Just unbelievable.

Aang used to come here
a long time ago.

I think he's a little shocked
it's so different.

So better!

This is supposed to be
the history of my people.

Ugh!

I'm sure some parts of the temple
are still the same.

AANG: It's nice to see at least
one part of the temple

that isn't ruined.

[MAN YELLS]

[ALL COUGHING]

What the doodle? Don't you know enough

to stay away from construction sites?

We have to make room
for the bathhouse.

Do you know what you did?

You just destroyed something sacred

for a stupid bathhouse.

Well, people around here
are starting to stink.

This whole place stinks.

Hyah!

This is a sacred temple.
You can't treat it this way.

I've seen it when the monks were here.

I know what it's supposed to be like.

The monks? But you're 12.

Dad, he's the Avatar.

He used to come here
a hundred years ago.

What are you doing?
Who said you could be here?

Doing here...

A long time ago,
but not a hundred years,

my people became refugees

after a terrible flood.

My infant son, Teo, was badly hurt

and lost his mother.

[SNIFFLES]

I needed somewhere to rebuild,

and I stumbled across this place.

Couldn't believe it.

Everywhere pictures of flying people,
but empty.

Nobody home.

Then I came across
these fan-like contraptions.

Our gliders.

Yes, little light flying machines.

They gave me an idea...

Build a new life for my son
in the air.

Then everyone would be
on equal ground,

so to speak.

We're just in the process of
improving upon what's already here.

And after all,
isn't that what nature does?

Nature knows where to stop.

I suppose that's true.

Unfortunately, progress has a way
of getting away from us.

Look at the time!

Come. The pulley system
must be oiled before dark.

Wait. How can you tell the time
from that thing?

The notches all look the same.

The candle will tell us. Watch.

You put spark powder in the candle!

Four flashes. So it's exactly
four hours past midday,

or as I call it, four o'candle.

Ha ha!

If you liked that,

wait till you see
my finger-safe knife sharpener.

It only took me three tries
to get it right.

Aah!

Follow me.

Hey, Aang,
I want to show you something.

AANG: I just can't get over it.

There's not a single thing
that's the same.

I don't know about that.

The temple might be different,

but the creatures that live here are
probably direct descendants

of the ones that lived here
a long time ago.

You're right. They're kind of keepers
of the temple's origins.

Besides, there is
one part of the temple

that hasn't changed at all.

KATARA: Hey...

It's just like the one
in the other air temple.

Only an airbender can open it.

So inside, it's completely untouched.

Just the way the monks left it.

I've always wondered
what it was like in there.

Aang?

I'm sorry.
This is the last part of the temple

that's the same as it was.

I want it to stay that way.

I completely understand.

I just wanted you to know it was here.

Thanks.

These lanterns are terrible.
I can't see.

Why would you
want to use fireflies for light?

Hey! Close that up. They'll get loose.

Fireflies are
a nonflammable light source.

Cover your nose and hold your breath.

OK. So you brought me
all the way down here

to see an empty room.

Wrong.

It's filled to the brim
with natural gas.

I came across it my first time here.

Unfortunately, I was
carrying a torch at the time.

Nearly blew myself and the whole place
even more sky-high.

I thought my eyebrows
would never grow back.

Anyway, there's a vital problem
that needs solving.

From time to time, we have gas leaks.

And they're nearly impossible to find.

So this place is an explosion
waiting to happen.

Yes. Until I figure out how to locate

something I can't see,
hear, smell, or touch.

TEO: The wind will carry you.

It supports something inside you,

something even lighter than air.

And that something
takes over when you fly.

I've changed my mind.

I think I was born
without that something.

Ha! Impossible. Everybody has it.

AANG: Spirit.

What?

That's the something
you're talking about.

Yeah. I suppose it is.

Are you ready?

No! Aah!

[LAUGHING]

I can't believe I'm flying!

Just make sure
you keep your mouth closed

so you don't swallow a bug.

Teo was right about the air.

All I had to do was trust it,

let it carry me.

Even though Teo's not an airbender,

he really does have the spirit of one.

I've been thinking.

If you want to see
what's in that room,

I'd be happy to open the door for you.

-Great.
-KATARA: Wait!

How do I land this thing?

What if I land over in the...

[GAGS]

Blech! Bug. bug.

That was a bug.

[CRASH]

I said, don't touch anything.

Oh!

Oh, don't worry.

That experiment is old,

and that egg was just
part of last week's lunch.

[SNIFFS] Ugh!

Week-old egg smell.

Quick, find that egg.

I can't believe I'm finally
going to see what's inside.

How could something that's so small,
you can't even see it,

make such a big stink?

That's the solution to our problem.

Yeah. If we put a whole mess
of rotten eggs

in the cellar
where the gas seeps up...

The gas will mix
with the smell of rotten eggs.

Then if there's a leak...

You smell rotten eggs.

Then you just follow your nose

to the place where the smell
is coming from...

And plug up the hole
where the gas is escaping.

-You're a genius!
-You're a genius!

[BELL RINGING]

Something is wrong. I've got to go.

This is a nightmare.

You don't understand.

You're making weapons
for the Fire Nation.

You make weapons for the Fire Nation?

Explain all this... Now!

It was about a year
after we moved here.

Fire Nation soldiers
found our settlement.

You were too young
to remember this tale.

They were going to destroy everything,

burn it to the ground.

I pleaded with them.
I begged them to spare us.

They asked what I had to offer.

I offered my services.

You must understand.
I did this for you.

[DOOR OPENS]

When are they coming?

Soon, very soon.

You can't give them more weapons.

If I don't give them what they want,

they will destroy this place.

How can I be proud of you

when your inventions
are being used for murder?

I need some time to think.

[BELL RINGING]

You need to leave. Go.

We're not leaving.

Then hide quickly.

You know better
than to keep me waiting.

Give me what you owe us
so I can be on my way.

Well? Is there a problem?

No. Right this way.

The deal is off.

The Avatar.

Aang, don't get involved.

If I don't get what I came for,

the Fire Nation
will burn this place to rubble.

Get out of here.

Uh!

You're leaving empty-handed.

Then the destruction of this temple
will be on your head.

This is bad, very bad.

Aang, what are we gonna do?

How can we possibly
keep them all away?

I'll tell you how.

We have something they don't...

Air power.

We control the sky.

That's something
the Fire Nation can't do.

We can win.

DAD: I want to help.

Good. We'll need it.

We finally got
the war balloon working,

thanks to Sokka.

This boy is a genius.

Thank you. You're a genius.

Thank you.

See, the problem
with the old war balloon was,

you could get it airborne,

but once you did, it just kept going.

You could put a hole in the top,

but then all the hot air would escape.

So the question became,
how do you keep a lid on hot air?

Ugh. If only we knew.

[LAUGHTER]

A lid is actually the answer.

If you control the hot air,
you control the war balloon.

Hmm, that's actually pretty smart.

OK. We got four kinds of bombs...

Smoke, slime, fire, and...

Stink.

Never underestimate
the power of stink.

They're coming!

Are we ready?

Yes, but where's Sokka
with the war balloon?

We'll have to start without it.

[CHEERING]

-Uhh!
-Uh!

Ooh!

Take them out of the sky now!

[ALL COUGHING]

We've got them on the run.

We need more slime.

Aah!

Huh!

Uhh... Uh!

Whoa!

Uh! Huh!

Uh! Huh! Yaah!

Those things are unstoppable.

I think I know how they work.

I remember my dad tinkering with
a counterbalancing system,

something to do with water.

Works great, huh?

Water? Can you get me close to one?

No problem.

Huh!

Huh!

[ROAR]

We're out of bombs.

Come on, Sokka.
Where's that war balloon?

Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?

The insignia.

They think we're on their side.

Then I guess
they won't see this coming.

Bombs away.

Uh! Hey! Aah!

Oh, no. That was the last one.

Wait a second. [SNIFFS]

You smell that?

Rotten eggs. There.

That's where the gas is escaping.

What are you doing?
That's our fuel source.

It's the only bomb we've got.

AANG: Look. They're retreating.

Yeah!

SOKKA: We're going down!

No! Sokka, hold on!

Get ready.

Oh!

AANG: You know what?

I'm really glad
you guys all live here now.

I realized it's like the hermit crab.

Maybe you weren't born here,

but you found this empty shell
and made it your home,

and now you protect each other.

That means a lot coming from you.

Aang, you were right about air power.

As long as we've got the skies,

we'll have the Fire Nation on the run.

[CHEERING]

This defeat is the gateway
to many victories.

I'm not one to complain,

but can't Appa fly any higher?

I have an idea.

Why don't we all get on your back,

and you can fly us to the North Pole.

I'd love to.

Climb on, everyone.

Sokka is ready for takeoff.

Look, we're all just a little tired
and cranky

because we've been flying
for two days straight.

And for what?


 


We can't even find
the Northern Water Tribe.

There's nothing up here.

[SPLASH]

Aagh!

[KIDS SCREAMING]

They're water benders.

We found the Water Tribe.

ZHAO: He's heading north.

The Northern Water Tribe.

The Avatar
needs to master waterbending.

He is looking for a teacher.

Then what are we waiting for?
Let's go get him.

Patience, Captain Li.

This isn't some little earth village

we can just march into.

The Water Tribe is a great nation.

There's a reason they've survived
100 years of war.

The frozen tundra is treacherous.

The landscape itself
is an icy fortress.

We'll need a massive invasion force.

There it is!

KATARA: The Northern Water Tribe.

We're finally here.

[MOMO COOS]

KATARA: I can't believe
how many waterbenders live up here.

We'll find a master
to teach us no problem.

KATARA: This place is beautiful.

Yeah.

She is.

[DRUMS BEATING]

[SCREAMS]

Tonight, we celebrate the arrival

of our brother and sister

from the Southern Tribe.

And they have brought with them
someone very special,

someone who many of us believed

disappeared from the world
until now...

The Avatar.

[CHEERING]

We also celebrate
my daughter's 16th birthday.

Princess Yue is now of marrying age.

Thank you, Father.

May the great Ocean and Moon Spirits

watch over us
during these troubled times.

Now, Master Pakku
and his students will perform!

[APPLAUSE]

Hi there. Sokka, Southern Water Tribe.

Very nice to meet you.

So, uh...

You're a princess, huh?

You know, back in my tribe,
I'm kind of like a prince myself.

Ha! The prince of what?

A lot of things!

Do you mind? I'm trying
to have a conversation here.

My apologies, Prince Sokka.

So, it looks like
I'm gonna be in town for a while.

I'm thinking maybe we could...

Do an activity together?

Do an activity?

[COUGHS]

Very smooth.

Master Pakku,

meet your newest student:

the Avatar.

Just because
you're destined to save the world,

don't expect any special treatment.

My friend and I can't wait
to start training with you...

After we relax for a couple of days.

If you want to relax,

then I suggest
visiting a tropical island.

If not, I'll see you both at sunrise.

Good night.

For the last time,
I'm not playing the sungi horn.

No, it's about our plans.

There is a bit of a problem.

I'm taking your crew.

What?

I've recruited them
for a little expedition

to the North Pole.

Uncle, is that true?

I'm afraid so.

He's taking everyone...

Even the cook.

Sorry you won't be there

to watch me capture the Avatar,

but I can't have you
getting in my way again.

-[GROWLS]
-No!

I didn't know you were skilled
with broadswords, Prince Zuko.

I'm not.

They're antiques.

Just decorative.

Have you heard of the Blue Spirit,
General Iroh?

Just rumors.

I don't think he is real.

He's real, all right.

He's a criminal

and an enemy of the Fire Nation.

But I have a feeling justice
will catch up with him soon.

General Iroh, the offer
to join my mission still stands...

If you change your mind.

I've waited for this day
my whole life.

I finally get to learn from
a real waterbending master!

Good morning, Master Pakku!

No, please! March right in!

I'm not concentrating or anything.

Uh, this is my friend... Katara...

The one I told you about.

I'm sorry.

I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

You didn't tell me
your friend was a girl.

In our tribe, it is forbidden

for women to learn waterbending.

What do you mean, you won't teach me?

I didn't travel
across the entire world

so you could tell me no!

No.

But there must be
other female waterbenders

in your tribe.

Here, the women learn from Yagoda

to use their waterbending to heal.

I'm sure she would be
happy to take you

as her student...

Despite your bad attitude.

I don't want to heal. I want to fight!

I can see that.

But our tribe has customs, rules.

Well, your rules stink!

Yeah!

They're not fair.

If you won't teach Katara, then...

Then what?

Then I won't learn from you!

Well, have fun teaching yourself.

I'm sure you'll do a great job.

Wait!

Aang didn't mean that.

You can't risk your training for me.

You have to learn from Master Pakku,

even if he is a big jerk.

Why don't we get started, then.

SOKKA: Princess Yue, good morning!

[PANTING]

Hey, how about that picnic last night?

Boy, your dad sure knows
how to throw a party.

I'm happy you enjoyed yourself.

Well, it wasn't as much fun
after you left.

So, I'm still hoping
we can see more of each other.

Do an activity, you mean?

Yes, at a place...

For some time.

I'd love to.

I'll meet you on that bridge tonight.

Great! I'll see you...

Aagh!

[GIGGLES] Sorry.

That's OK. It was worth it.

See you tonight.

ZHAO: I'm very impressed.

You all seem highly qualified

for the mission I have in mind.

[SQUAWKING]

That's some tasty gold.

What do you need us to do?

I believe you're acquainted
with Prince Zuko.

Um, hi.

Are you Yagoda?

Are you here for the healing lesson?

I guess I am.

Welcome!

Welcome!

You're moving the water around,

but you're not feeling
the push and pull.

I'm trying.

[SLURP]

Ahh!

Maybe that move
is too advanced for you.

Why don't you try an easier one?

[GROWLS]

Thanks for the lesson.

So, who's the lucky boy?

Huh?

Your betrothal necklace.

You're getting married, right?

Oh, no.

I don't think I'm ready for that yet.

My grandmother
gave my mother this necklace,

and my mother passed it down to me.

I recognize this carving!

I don't know
why I didn't realize sooner.

You're the spitting image of Kanna.

Wait!

How do you know my gran-gran's name?

When I was about your age,

I was friends with Kanna.

She was born here...

In the Northern Tribe.

She never told me.

Your grandmother
had an arranged marriage

with a young waterbender.

He carved that necklace for her.

If gran-gran was engaged,
why did she leave?

I don't know.

That's always been a mystery to me.

She left without saying good-bye.

IROH: Good luck!

The crew wanted me
to wish you safe travels.

Good riddance to those traitors.

It's a lovely night for a walk.

Why don't you join me?

It would clear your head.

Or just stay in your room

and sit in the dark.

Whatever makes you happy.

[DOOR CLOSES]

[HUMMING]

Whoa!

Careful with the blasting jelly.

-[SQUEAK]
-Ooh!

Uncle?

Uncle, is that you?

[SQUAWK]

Aah!

[ZUKO SCREAMING]

Zuko!

Zuko.

Hi, Princess Yue.

I made you something.

I carved it myself.

It's a bear.

Actually, it's supposed to be a fish.

See, it has a fin.

Oh.

I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

I shouldn't have
asked you to come here.

[GRUNTS]

KATARA: How's warrior training going?

[GROWLS]

That bad?

No, it's Princess Yue.

I don't get it.

One minute,
she wants to go out with me,

and the next,
she's telling me to get lost.

So, how's waterbending training?

Master Poop-head won't teach her
because she's a girl.

Why don't you just teach her, Aang?

Why didn't I think of that?

At night, you can teach me

whatever moves
you learn from Master Pakku.

That way,
you have someone to practice with,

and I get to learn waterbending.

Everyone's happy!

I'm not happy.

But you're never happy.

Come on, Aang.

Master Pakku said this move

is all about sinking and floating.

I got it!

That was amazing!

That wasn't me.

I was just showing Katara a few moves.

You have disrespected me,

my teachings, and my entire culture.

I'm sorry, I...

You are no longer welcome
as my student.

What do you want me to do?

Force Master Pakku to take Aang back

as his student?

Yes. Please.

I suspect he might change his mind

if you swallow your pride
and apologize to him.

Fine.

I'm waiting, little girl.

No!

No way am I apologizing
to a sour old man like you!

AANG: Uh, Katara...

I'll be outside
if you're man enough to fight me.

I'm sure she didn't mean that.

Yeah, I think she did.

I'm devastated
to hear about Prince Zuko.

Just devastated.

The Fire Lord will not be pleased

when he learns who was responsible.

You know who was behind the attack?

Yes. Pirates.

We had a run-in with them
a while back.

They wanted revenge.

So, have you reconsidered my offer?

Yes, I accept.

It will be an honor
to serve as your general.

To the Fire Nation.

To victory!

SOKKA: Are you crazy, Katara?

You're not gonna win this fight.

I know. I don't care.

You don't have to do this for me.

I can find another teacher.

I'm not doing it for you.

Someone needs to
slap some sense into that guy.

So, you decided to show up?

Aren't you gonna fight?

Go back to the healing huts

with the other women,
where you belong.

Fine.

You want to learn to fight so bad,

study closely.

Don't worry.
I'm not going to hurt you.

Ow!

You can't knock me down!

AANG: Go, Katara!

[CHEERING]

[CHEERING]

[PANTING]

Well, I'm impressed.

You are an excellent waterbender.

But you still won't teach me,
will you?

No.

[PANTING]

This fight is over.

Come back here. I'm not finished yet.

Yes. You are.

This is my necklace.

No, it's not. It's mine. Give it back!

I made this 60 years ago...

For the love of my life...

For Kanna.

My gran-gran
was supposed to marry you?

Our plan is working perfectly.

Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.

You didn't have to do this.

No nephew of mine
is going to stow away on a ship

without some backup.

Thank you, Uncle.

[DOOR OPENS]

Someone's coming.

Stay hidden
until we get to the North Pole

and the Avatar will be yours.

Good luck.

I carved this necklace
for your grandmother

when we got engaged.

I thought we would have
a long happy life together.

I loved her.

But she didn't love you, did she?

It was an arranged marriage.

Gran-gran wouldn't let your tribe's
stupid customs run her life.

That's why she left.

It must have taken a lot of courage.

[SOBBING]

Go get her.

What do you want from me?

Nothing.

I just want you to know
I think you're beautiful.

And I never thought a girl like you
would even notice a guy like me.

You don't understand.

No, no.

See, that's the thing.

I think I do understand now.

You're a princess, and I'm...

I'm just a southern peasant.

No, Sokka.

It's OK.

You don't have to say anything.

I'll see you around, OK.

OK, now I'm really confused!

Happy, but confused.

I do like you... A lot!

But we can't be together.

And not for the reason you think.

It's because...

I'm engaged.

I'm sorry.

Not bad. Not bad.

Ha ha ha ha.

Keep practicing,
and maybe you'll get it

by the time you're my age.

[PANTING]

Hey, Katara.

What do you think you're doing?

It's past sunrise.

You're late.

Good to see you here.

You, too.

My fleet is ready.

Set a course
for the Northern Water Tribe.

Nice try, Pupil Sangok.

A couple of more years,

and you might be ready
to fight a sea sponge.

Whoa!

Would anyone care for
a rematch with Katara?

[GROANING]

Katara, you've
advanced more quickly

than any student I've ever trained.

You have proven
that with fierce determination,

passion, and hard work,

you can accomplish anything.

Raw talent alone is not enough.

Pupil Aang!


 


Yes, Master Pakku?

Care to step into
the sparring circle?

I figure since you've found time
to play with house pets,

you must have
already mastered waterbending.

I wouldn't say mastered,

but check this out!

YUE: So, they don't have palaces
in the Southern Tribe?

Are you kidding?

I grew up in a block of ice.

It's not exactly a cultural hub.

[GIGGLES]

Sokka, this is wrong.

What's wrong?

We're taking a walk!

I'm engaged.

It just feels...

I know what you need.

You need to meet my good friend Appa.

Who?

[GROWLING]

Appa and I go way back,
don't we, boy?

Aagh! Easy!

Down, boy!

No, up!

YUE: Looks like you haven't been
giving Appa enough attention.

[CHUCKLES]

So, how does this work?

You hanging on tight?

Mm-hmm.

Yip, yip.

Oh, my goodness!

Wow!

I can't believe you do this every day.

Yeah, we pretty much live up here.

Is it always this cold in the sky?

Not when you're with someone.

It's beautiful up here.

Yeah.

Whoo, yeah!

[INHALES DEEPLY]

Good times, good times.

Hey, look.

YUE: What's happening?

[GROWLS]

Oh, no.

[LAUGHING]

[COUGHS]

SOKKA: Soot.
YUE: What?

I've seen it before.

Right before my village was attacked.

It's soot mixed with snow.

But why?

It's the Fire Nation.

They've closed in on the North Pole.

And from the looks of this stuff,

I'd say there's a lot of them.

ZHAO: This will truly be one for
the history books, General Iroh.

Just think. Centuries from now,

people will study
the Great Admiral Zhao,

who destroyed the last

of the Water Tribe civilization.

You're lucky you're here to see it.

Be careful what you wish for, Admiral.

History is not always kind
to its subjects.

I suppose you speak from experience.

But, rest assured,
this will be nothing like

your legendary failure at Ba Sing Se.

I hope not, for your sake.

Tell the captains to prepare
for first strike.

We'll be landing soon.

Do you have a plan?

I'm working on it, Uncle.

[DRUM POUNDING]

What's wrong? We have to go!

No, Sokka.

Wait.

I can't see you anymore.

Not at all.

What? We're just friends.

I wish we could just be friends.

But I like you too much,

and it's too confusing
to be around you.

I'm marrying someone else.

You don't love him, do you?

You don't even seem to like him.

But I do love my people.

You're not marrying them!

You don't understand.

I have duties to my father,

to my tribe.

I have to do this.

Good-bye.

The day we have feared
for so long has arrived.

The Fire Nation is on our doorstep.

It is with great sadness

I call my family here before me,

knowing well that some of these faces

are about to vanish from our tribe.

But they will never vanish
from our hearts.

Now, as we approach
the battle for our existence,

I call upon the great spirits.

Spirit of the ocean,

spirit of the moon, be with us!

I'm going to need volunteers
for a dangerous mission.

-Count me in.
-Sokka...

Be warned.

Many of you will not return.

Come forward to receive my mark

if you accept the task.

The stillness before battle
is unbearable.

Such a quiet dread.

I wasn't there when the Fire Nation
attacked my people.

I'm gonna make a difference this time.

[SCREAMING]

[SNARLS]

Yip, yip!

Katara!

[YELLS]

[GRUNTS]

I'll take it from here, boy.

Appa!

Thanks for the rescue, buddy.

You've gotta be kidding me.

Men, you'll be infiltrating
the Fire Nation navy.

That means you'll all need
one of these uniforms.

[LAUGHTER]

What's your problem?

Fire navy uniforms
don't look like that.

Of course they do.

These are real uniforms captured
from actual fire navy soldiers.

When, like, 100 years ago?

85.

The Fire Nation doesn't wear
shoulder spikes anymore.

The newer uniforms
are more streamlined.

How do we know we can trust this guy?

Such bold talk for a new recruit.

Sokka is from our sister tribe, Hahn.

He is a capable warrior,
and I value his input.

Now, our first objective
is to determine

the identity
of their commanding officer.

His name is Zhao.

Middle-aged, big sideburns,
bigger temper...

Sokka, I want you to tell
everything you know to Hahn.

He's leading this mission.

Hahn, show Sokka your respect.

I expect nothing less
from my future son-in-law.

Princess Yue's marrying you?

Yeah. What of it?

Nothing. Congratulations.

Stop those fireballs!

IROH: It's almost twilight, Admiral.

As your military consultant,

I must advise you to halt your attack.

The waterbenders draw their power
from the moon,

and it is nearly full tonight.

You should wait
and resume the attack at daybreak.

ZHAO: Oh, I am well aware
of the moon problem.

And I'm working on a solution.

But for now, daybreak it is.

YUE: They've stopped firing.

Aang!

I can't do it.

I can't do it.

KATARA: What happened?

I must have taken out
a dozen fire navy ships,

but there's just too many of them.

I can't fight them all!

But you have to.

You're the Avatar.

I'm just one kid.

If you are fishing
for an octopus, my nephew,

you need a tightly woven net,

or he will squeeze through
the tiniest hole and escape.

I don't need your wisdom
right now, Uncle.

I'm sorry, I just nag you because...

Well, ever since I lost my son...

Uncle, you don't have to say it.

I think of you as my own.

I know, Uncle.

We'll meet again.

After I have the Avatar.

Remember your breath of fire.

It could save your life out there.

I will.

And put your hood up.

Keep your ears warm.

I'll be fine!

Let me tell you, Sokka,

I've courted a lot of girls,
but Yue is the finest.

And she comes with the most perks.

Perks?! What does that mean?

I mean,
Yue's nice and everything,

but the points I'll gain
with the chief aren't bad either.

Princess Yue is wasted
on a self-absorbed weasel like you!

Whoa, hang on!

What do you care?

You're just a simple rube
from the Southern Tribe.

What would you know of the political
complexities of our life?

No offense.

[SCREAMS]

You're just a jerk without a soul!
No offense!

That's enough!

Sokka, you're off the mission.

All right, fall in, men!

Everybody listen to what I say,

and we'll take out this Admiral Cho
in no time!

It's Admiral Zhao!

[ANIMALS CALLING]

Where are they going?

They're coming up for air somewhere.

[INHALES DEEPLY]

YUE: The legends say the moon
was the first waterbender.

Our ancestors saw how it pushed
and pulled the tides,

and learned how to do it themselves.

KATARA: I've always noticed
my waterbending is stronger at night.

Our strength comes from
the spirit of the moon,

our life comes from the spirit
of the ocean.

They work together to keep balance.

The spirits.

Maybe I can find them
and get their help.

How can you do that?

The avatar is the bridge

between our world
and the spirit world.

Aang can talk to them!

Maybe they'll give you the wisdom
to win this battle.

Or maybe they'll unleash

a crazy-amazing spirit attack
on the Fire Nation!

Or wisdom. That's good, too.

The only problem is,

the last time you got
to the spirit world by accident.

How are you going
to get there this time?

I have an idea. Follow me.

So, is this the way
to the spirit world?

Ha ha ha. No.

You'll have to get there on your own.
But I can take you

to the most spiritual place
in the entire North Pole.

[GASPS]

I never thought
I'd miss grass this much!

It's so warm here!
How is that possible?

It's the center
of all spiritual energy in our land.

You're right, Yue.

I can feel...

Something.

It's so...

Tranquil.

[ANIMALS CALLING]

[SHUDDERING]

Be quiet!

[LOWING STOPS]

[LOWING]

CHIEF: Is something wrong, Sokka?

Oh, no.

Hahn's out there
on the top-secret mission,

while I'm here
sharpening my boomerang.

Everything's fine.

Listen to me.

I took you off the mission
for selfish reasons.

I have a special task in mind for you.

What, you want me
to scrub the barracks?

I want you to guard my daughter,
Princess Yue.

Oh. Sure.

That shouldn't be too hard.

[GASPING]

[GASPING]

YUE: [WHISPERING]
Why is he sitting like that?

He's meditating.

Trying to cross over
into the spirit world.

It takes all his concentration.

Is there any way we can help?

AANG: How about some quiet?!

Come on, guys,
I can hear every word you're saying.

Is he OK?

He's crossing into the spirit world.

He'll be fine as long as
we don't move his body.

That's his way back
to the physical world.

Maybe we should get some help?

No. He's my friend.

I'm perfectly capable
of protecting him.

ZUKO: Well, aren't you a big girl now?

No...

Yes.

Hand him over
and I won't have to hurt you.

Hyah!

I see you've learned a new trick.

But I didn't come this far
to lose to you.

You little peasant.

You've found a master, haven't you?

Hyah!

Hyah! Hyah...

Aah! Uh!

Hyah! Hyah...

It's daybreak at last.

Let's write history.

You rise with the moon,
I rise with the sun.

[ALL YELLING]

The Water Tribe can try
to resist the inevitable,

but their city will fall today.

[GASPS]

Aang?!

What happened?! Where's Zuko?!

He took Aang.

He took him right out from under me.

Where did they go?

I can't believe I lost him.

You did everything you could...

and now we need to do everything
we can to get him back.

Zuko can't have gotten far. We'll find him.
Aang's gonna be fine.

Okay.

It's all right. You stay here,
Momo, in case Aang comes back.

Yip! Yip!

Hello? I'm sorry
to disturb you...

but I just really need to find
the Moon and the Ocean spirits.

Go... away.


 


You're still here?

Yes! I need...

Perhaps that thing will help you?
Chase it!

Finally!

Come back!

Hello, Aang.

Roku!

Shelter!

Roku, the Water Tribe is under attack. I
need to find the Ocean and Moon spirits!

The Ocean and the Moon
are ancient spirits.

They crossed over from the Spirit World to
the Mortal World very near the beginning.

There is only one spirit I know
of who is old enough to remember.

Who?

The spirit's name is Koh. But he is very
dangerous. They call him... the Face Stealer.

When you speak with him you must be very
careful to show no emotion at all...

not the slightest expression
or he will steal your face!

I finally have you. But I can't get
you home because of this blizzard.

There's always something. Not
that you would understand.

You're like my sister. Everything always...
came easy to her.

She's a firebending prodigy...
and everyone adores her.

My father says she was born lucky.
He says I was lucky to be born.

I don't need luck though,
I don't want it.

I've always had to struggle and
fight and that's made me strong.

It's made me who I am.

I don't need to remind you
we have a time limit.

If we don't defeat the Water Tribe before the
full moon rises they will be undefeatable.

I assure you I have
everything under control.

I intend to remove the
moon as a factor.

Remove the moon!? How?

Admiral Choi!

Prepare to meet your fate!

As I was saying... years ago I stumbled
upon a great and powerful secret...

the identity of the Moon
Spirit's mortal form.

What?

I was a young Lieutenant serving under
General Shu in the Earth Kingdom...

I discovered a hidden library, underground
in fact. I tore through scroll after scroll.

One of them contained a detailed illustration
and the words "moon" and "ocean."

I knew then that these spirits
could be found... and killed.

And that it was my
destiny to do so.

Zhao, the Spirits are
not to be trifled with!

Yes, yes, I know you
fear the Spirits, Iroh.

I've heard rumors about your
journey into the Spirit World.

But the Ocean and Moon gave up their
immortality to become a part of our world...

and now they will face
the consequences!

Oh! Whew! You're just a
curly tailed blue nose.

Show no fear. Show
no emotion at all.

Hello? I'm looking for
a spirit named "Koh."

Welcome!

Thank you.

My old friend, the Avatar.
It's been a long time.

You know me?

How could I forget you!

One of your previous
incarnations tried to slay me!

It was eight or nine
hundred years ago.

I didn't know that. Why did he...
or I... try to kill you?

Oh... it was something about stealing
the face of someone you loved...

Of course, that's all behind us.

Why should I hold a grudge against
you for something in a past life?

After all, you're a different person now.
You've come to me... with a new face.

Guess we'll be here awhile.

Don't worry! Prince Zuko can't be
getting too far in this weather.

I'm not worried they'll get away in the
blizzard. I'm worried that they won't.

They're not gonna die
in this blizzard.

If we know anything it's
that Zuko never gives up.

They'll survive...
and we'll find them!

It's been a long time since I've added
a child's face to my collection.

So... how may I help you?

I need to find the
Moon and the Ocean.

Their spirit names
are Tui and La.

Push... and Pull... and that has been the
nature of their relationship for all time.

Please, help me find them.

An entire culture could be destroyed
if I don't get their help.

Oh, you think you need their help?
Actually, it's quite the other way around.

Someone's going to kill them!

What do you mean? How can I
find them and protect them?

You've already met
them, actually.

Tui and La, your
Moon and Ocean...

have always circled each
other in an eternal dance.

They balance each other... push and pull...
life and death...

good and evil... yin...
and yang.

The koi fish!

I must be going now.

We'll meet again.

The spirits are in trouble. I need
to get back to the physical world.

A friend is here
to guide you back.

Hei-Bai!

We'll be following this map
to a very special location.

And when we get there...
we're going fishing.

This is where I came in.
But how do I get back?

Good riddance.

Momo!

Momo? Oh no! Where's my body?

Look! That's gotta be Aang!
Yip! Yip!

Welcome back.

Good to be back.

That won't be enough to escape.

Appa!

Here for a rematch?

Trust me, Zuko, it's not
going to be much of a match.

Hey! This is some quality rope!

We need to get to the oasis!
The spirits are in trouble!

Wait, we can't just
leave him here.

Sure we can. Let's go.

No, if we leave him, he'll die.

Yeh, this makes a lot of sense. Let's bring
the guy who's constantly trying to kill us!

Are you okay?

I feel faint.

I feel it too.

The Moon Spirit is in trouble.

I owe the Moon Spirit my life.

What do you mean?

When I was born I was
very sick and very weak.

Most babies cry when
they're born...

but I was born as if I were asleep.
My eyes closed.

Our healers did
everything they could.

They told my mother and
father I was going to die.

My father pleaded with the
spirits to save me...

that night, beneath
the full moon...

he brought me to the oasis
and placed me in the pond.

My dark hair turned white, I
opened my eyes and began to cry...

and they knew I would live.

That's why my mother named
me Yue, for the moon.

I am... a legend now! The Fire Nation will
for generations tell stories about...

the great Zhao who
darkened the moon!

They will call me Zhao the Conqueror! Zhao
the Moon Slayer! Zhao The Invincible!

Huh! Get it off! Get if off!

Don't bother!

Zhao! Don't!

It's my destiny... to destroy the Moon...
and the Water Tribe.

Destroying the moon won't
hurt just the Water Tribe.

It will hurt everyone...
including you.

Without the moon, everything
would fall out of balance.

You have no idea what kind of chaos
that would unleash on the world.

He is right, Zhao!

General Iroh, why am I not surprised
to discover your treachery?

I'm no traitor, Zhao, the Fire
Nation needs the moon too.

We all depend on the balance.

Whatever you do to that spirit I'll
unleash on you ten-fold! Let it go, now!

There's no hope now. It's over.

No, it's not over.

You're alive?

You tried to have me killed!

Yes, I did. You're the Blue Spirit...
and enemy of the Fire Nation!

You freed the Avatar!

I had no choice!

You should have chosen to accept
your failure... your disgrace!

Then, at least you
could have lived!

It's too late. It's dead.

You have been touched by the Moon Spirit.
Some of its life is in you!

Yes, you're right. It gave me life.
Maybe I can give it back.

No! You don't have to do that!

It's my duty, Sokka.

I won't let you! Your father
told me to protect you!

I have to do this.

No!

She's gone. She's gone.

Goodbye, Sokka. I will
always be with you.

It can't be!

Take my hand!

I've decided to go
to the South Pole.

Some other benders and
healers want to join me.

It's time we helped
rebuild our sister tribe.

What about Aang? He still
needs to learn waterbending.

Well, then he better get used
to calling you "Master Katara."

The Spirits gave me a
vision when Yue was born.

I saw... a beautiful, brave young woman...
become the Moon Spirit.

I knew this day would come.

You must be proud.

So proud. And sad.

I'm surprised, Prince Zuko...

surprised that you are not at this
moment trying to capture the Avatar.

I'm tired.

Then you should rest.
A man needs his rest.

You too, Momo.

Come here.

Iroh is a traitor and your brother Zuko
is a failure. I have a task for you.
