        <p class="para">Hello! I have been doing art for a very long time, and have tried many different styles and mediums. Each of these pieces has a story and a description, but I won't discuss every little thing for every piece, just the important things like the medium(s)!</p>
        
        <a href="img/BirdardPoster.pdf" class="para" >Birdard Poster</a> 
        <p class="para">This is Birdard's humble beginning, done in Photoshop. He is modeled after a hummingbird, but without bird legs. So, he has bigger legs. He was a bunch of fun to create, and I am making a graphic novel for him and a few other characters I have made for his universe!</p>
        
        <img class="photo" src="images/BallerinaNoir.jpg" alt="Ballerina Noir, a chiaroscuro charcoal piece"/> 
        <p class="para">Ballerina Noir is a chiaroscuro piece done in charcoal. It was a class assignment, so I did have a reference picture. However, the reference was a photo, not someone else's art. So, it is more like a study, but I absolutely love it! </p>
        
        <img class="photo" src="images/Snickerdoodle.jpg" alt="Photo of my orange cat Snickerdoodle"/>
        <p class="para">Snickerdoodle liked to sit on shoulders and to go on walks. In this photo, he was sitting on my shoulder (guest-starring in the bottom right-hand corner) so this was a particularly difficult picture to take!</p>
        
        <img class="photo" src="images/TreeHallway.jpg" alt="My dog Kenai standing in our tree hallway"/>
        <p class="para">Kenai is a Husky and German-Shepard (which gives him his wolf-like appearance). On this specific morning he was getting in a lot of good poses and looking especially dignified.</p>
        
        <img class="photo" src="images/Tula.jpg" alt="My cat Tula"/>
        <p class="para">This is my cat Tula. She is a model of a cat. She gives me a lot to work with, but she also wants constant pats which makes taking the photos difficult! She is a particularly nice subject because of her eyes. She has the biggest eyes I have ever seen on a cat.</p>
        
        <img class="photo" src="images/MooniesCereal.jpg" alt="A space-themed cereal box I designed in 3D in high school"/>
        <p class="para">I made this very puny cereal box using Adobe Illustrator in  high school. I think that a very open market is making space-themed cereal, and since my last name is Mooney I saw an opportunity and seized it!</p>
        
        <img class="photo" src="images/Korra.PNG" alt="Art I made for my brother of his dog Korra" />
        <p class="para">Korra is my brother's dog, and I made this piece, in ProCreate, for him and his wife. And, yes, her name is a reference to <i>the Legend of Korra</i>.</p>
